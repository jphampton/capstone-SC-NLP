   Justice Alito delivered the opinion of the Court.

   Before us for review are orders of a three-judge court in the Western District of Texas effectively directing the State not to conduct this year's elections using districting plans that the court itself adopted some years earlier. The court developed those plans for use in the 2012 elections pursuant to our directions in Perry v. Perez, 565 U. S. 388 (2012) (per curiam). We instructed the three-judge court to start with the plans adopted by the Texas Legislature in 2011 but to make adjustments as required by the Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. Id., at 392-396. After those plans were used in 2012, the Texas Legislature enacted them (with only minor modifications) in 2013, and the plans were used again in both 2014 and 2016.

   Last year, however, the three-judge court reversed its prior analysis and held that some of the districts in those plans are unlawful. After reviewing the repealed 2011 plans, which had never been used, the court found that they were tainted by discriminatory intent and that the 2013 Legislature had not "cured" that "taint."

   We now hold that the three-judge court committed a fundamental legal error. It was the challengers' burden to show that the 2013 Legislature acted with discriminatory intent when it enacted plans that the court itself had produced. The 2013 Legislature was not obligated to show that it had "cured" the unlawful intent that the court attributed to the 2011 Legislature. Thus, the essential pillar of the three-judge court's reasoning was critically flawed.

   When the congressional and state legislative districts are reviewed under the proper legal standards, all but one of them, we conclude, are lawful.


   A

   The 2010 decennial census revealed that the population of Texas had grown by more than 20% and the State was therefore apportioned four additional seats in the United States House of Representatives. C. J. S. 369a.[1] To accommodate this new allocation and the population changes shown by the census, the Legislature adopted a new congressional districting plan, as well as new districting maps for the two houses of the State Legislature.

   Redistricting is never easy, and the task was especially complicated in Texas in 2011. Not only was the Legislature required to draw districts that were substantially equal in population, see Perry, supra, at 391-392; Rey- nolds v. Sims, 377 U. S. 533 (1964); Wesberry v. Sanders, 376 U. S. 1 (1964), and to comply with special state-law districting rules,[2] but federal law imposed complex and delicately balanced requirements regarding the consideration of race.

   Then, as now, federal law restricted the use of race in making districting decisions. The Equal Protection Clause forbids "racial gerrymandering," that is, intentionally assigning citizens to a district on the basis of race without sufficient justification. Shaw v. Reno, 509 U. S. 630, 641 (1993). It also prohibits intentional "vote dilution"--"invidiously . . . minimiz[ing] or cancel[ing] out the voting potential of racial or ethnic minorities." Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U. S. 55, 66-67 (1980) (plurality opinion).

   While the Equal Protection Clause imposes these important restrictions, its application in the field of districting is complicated. For one thing, because a voter's race sometimes correlates closely with political party preference, see Cooper v. Harris, 581 U. S. ___, ___-___ (2017) (slip op., at 19-20); Easley v. Cromartie, 532 U. S. 234, 243 (2001), it may be very difficult for a court to determine whether a districting decision was based on race or party preference. Here, the three-judge court found that the two factors were virtually indistinguishable.[3]

   At the same time that the Equal Protection Clause restricts the consideration of race in the districting process, compliance with the Voting Rights Act of 1965, 79Stat. 437, as amended, 52 U. S. C. §10301 et seq. (VRA), pulls in the opposite direction: It often insists that districts be created precisely because of race. Two provisions of the VRA exert such demands, and in 2011, Texas was subject to both. At that time, Texas was covered by §5 of the VRA[4] and was thus barred from making any districting changes unless it could prove that they did not result in "retrogression" with respect to the ability of racial minorities to elect the candidates of their choice. Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, 575 U. S. ___, ___ (2015) (slip op., at 3). That showing obviously demanded consideration of race.

   On top of this, Texas was (and still is) required to comply with §2 of the VRA. A State violates §2 if its districting plan provides " `less opportunity' " for racial minorities " `to elect representatives of their choice.' " League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry, 548 U. S. 399, 425 (2006) (LULAC). In a series of cases tracing back to Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U. S. 30 (1986), we have interpreted this standard to mean that, under certain circumstance, States must draw "opportunity" districts in which minority groups form "effective majorit[ies]," LULAC, supra, at 426.

   Since the Equal Protection Clause restricts consideration of race and the VRA demands consideration of race, a legislature attempting to produce a lawful districting plan is vulnerable to " `competing hazards of liability.' " Bush v. Vera, 517 U. S. 952, 977 (1996) (plurality opinion). In an effort to harmonize these conflicting demands, we have assumed that compliance with the VRA may justify the consideration of race in a way that would not otherwise be allowed. In technical terms, we have assumed that complying with the VRA is a compelling state interest, see, e.g., Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 580 U. S. ___, ___ (2017) (slip op., at 13); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U. S. 899, 915 (1996), and that a State's consideration of race in making a districting decision is narrowly tailored and thus satisfies strict scrutiny if the State has " `good reasons' " for believing that its decision is necessary in order to comply with the VRA. Cooper, supra, at ___ (slip op., at 3).

   B

   Facing this legal obstacle course, the Texas Legislature in 2011 adopted new districting plans, but those plans were immediately tied up in litigation and were never used. Several plaintiff groups quickly filed challenges in the District Court for the Western District of Texas, arguing that some of the districts in the new plans were racial gerrymanders, some were based on intentional vote dilution, and some had the effect of depriving minorities of the equal opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice. This case was assigned to a three-judge court, as required by 28 U. S. C. §2284(a). (We will call this court "the Texas court" or simply "the District Court.")

   The situation was further complicated by the requirement that Texas obtain preclearance of its new plans. To do this, Texas filed for a declaratory judgment in the District Court for the District of Columbia. See Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d 133 (2012). (We will call this court "the D. C. court.") By early 2012, the D. C. court had not yet issued a decision, and Texas needed usable plans for its rapidly approaching primaries. Accordingly, the Texas court drew up interim plans for that purpose. Perez v. Perry, 835 F. Supp. 2d 209 (2011). In creating those plans, the majority of the Texas court thought that it was not "required to give any deference to the Legislature's enacted plan." Id., at 213. Instead, it based its plans on what it called "neutral principles that advance the interest of the collective public good." Id., at 212.[5]

   Texas challenged those court-ordered plans in this Court, and we reversed. Perry v. Perez, 565 U. S. 388 (2012) (per curiam). Noting that "[r]edistricting is `primarily the duty and responsibility of the State,' " we held that the Texas court should have respected the legislative judgments embodied in the 2011 plans to the extent allowed by the Constitution and the VRA. Id., at 392-399.

   We remanded the case with very specific instructions. The Texas court was told to start with the plans adopted by the Legislature but to modify those plans as needed so as "not to incorporate . . . any legal defects." Id., at 394. With respect to claims under the Constitution or §2 of the VRA, the District Court was told to change a district if the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their challenge. Ibid. And with respect to §5 claims, the court was instructed to make whatever changes were needed to obviate any legal claim that was "not insubstantial."[6] Id., at 395. Thus, our instructions, in an abundance of caution, demanded changes in the challenged 2011 plans without proof that those changes were actually required by either the Constitution or the VRA.

   On remand, the Texas court ordered additional briefing and heard two more days of argument. App. 29a, 35a-50a; Order in Civ. No. 11-cv-00360, Doc. No. 616. It issued two opinions, totaling more than 70 pages, and analyzed disputed districts in detail. C. J. S. 367a-423a; H. J. S. 300a-315a. While stressing the preliminary nature of its determinations, see C. J. S. 368a; H. J. S. 314a-315a, the court found that some districts required change and that others were lawful, C. J. S. 367a-423a; H. J. S. 300a-315a. The court then adopted plans for the State's congressional districts and for both houses of the State Legislature. (The plan for the State Senate is not at issue.)

   Both the congressional plan and the plan for the Texas House departed significantly from the State's 2011 plans. At least 8 of the 36 congressional districts were markedly altered, and 21 districts in the plan for the Texas House were "substantially" changed. H. J. S. 314a; C. J. S. 397a-408a.

   In August 2012, the D. C. court denied preclearance of the plans adopted by the Legislature in 2011, see Texas v. United States, supra, so the State conducted the 2012 elections under the interim plans devised by the Texas court. At the same time, Texas filed an appeal in this Court contesting the decision of the D. C. court,[7] but that appeal ultimately died for two reasons.

   First, the 2011 plans were repealed. The Texas attorney general urged the Legislature to pass new redistricting plans, C. J. S. 429a, and in his view, the "best way to remedy the violations found by the D. C. court" was to "adopt the [Texas court's] interim plans as the State's permanent redistricting maps." Id., at 432a. Doing so, he said, would "confirm the legislature's intent" to adopt "a redistricting plan that fully comports with the law." Id., at 429a.

   The Governor called a special session to do just that, and the Legislature complied. One of the legislative sponsors, Senator Seliger, explained that, although " `the Texas Legislature remains confident that the legislatively-drawn maps adopted in 2011 are fair and legal . . . , there remain several outstanding legal questions regarding these maps that undermine the stability and predictability of the electoral process in Texas.' " 274 F. Supp. 3d 624, 649, n. 40 (2017). Counsel for one of the plaintiff groups, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), testified in favor of the plans. C. J. S. 436a-439a. The 2013 Legislature then repealed the 2011 plans and enacted the Texas court's interim plans with just a few minor changes. The federal congressional plan was not altered at all, and only small modifications were made to the plan for the Texas House. C. J. S. Findings 231a-232a.

   On the day after the Legislature passed the new plans and the day before the Governor signed them, this Court issued its decision in Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U. S. 529 (2013), which invalidated the coverage formula in §4 of the Voting Rights Act. Now no longer subject to §5, Texas obtained a vacatur of the D. C. court's order on preclearance. 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 634-635, and n. 11.

   With the never-effective 2011 plans now repealed and any preclearance issues overcome by events, the State argued in the Texas court that the plaintiffs' case against the 2011 plans was moot. In September 2013, the Texas court allowed the plaintiffs to amend their complaints to challenge the 2013 plans, but the court held that their challenges to the 2011 plans were still alive, reasoning that the repeal of the 2011 plans represented the "voluntary cessation" of allegedly unconstitutional conduct.[8]

   Texas conducted its 2014 and 2016 elections under the plans that had been preliminarily approved by the Texas court and subsequently adopted (with only minor changes) by the Legislature in 2013. But in March and April 2017, after multiple trials, the Texas court issued a pair of rulings on the defunct 2011 plans. The court reaffirmed the conclusions it had reached in 2012 about defects in the 2011 plans, and it went further. Contrary to its earlier decision, it held that Congressional District (CD) 35 is an impermissible racial gerrymander and that CD27 violates §2 of the Voting Rights Act because it has the effect of diluting the electoral opportunities of Latino voters. C. J. S. 181a, 193a-194a. Previously, the court had provided detailed reasons for rejecting the very arguments that it now accepted. Id., at 409a-423a. Similarly, the court held that multiple districts in the plan for the Texas House were the result of intentional vote dilution. These included districts in the counties of
   Nueces (House District (HD) 32, HD34), Bell (HD54, HD55), and Dallas (HD103, HD104, HD105). H. J. S. 275a-276a.[9]

   In August 2017, having ruled on the repealed 2011 plans, the Texas court finally turned its attention to the plans then in effect--i.e., the plans that had been developed by the court, adopted by the Legislature in 2013, and used in both the 2014 and 2016 elections. The court invalidated the districts in those plans that correspond to districts in the 2011 plan that it had just held to be unlawful, i.e., CD27, CD35, HD32, HD34, HD54, HD55, HD103, HD104, and HD105. See 274 F. Supp. 3d 624 (2017) (No. 17-586) and 267 F. Supp. 3d 750 (2017) (No. 17-626).

   In reaching these conclusions, the court pointed to the discriminatory intent allegedly harbored by the 2011 Legislature, and it attributed this same intent to the 2013 Legislature because it had failed to "engage in a deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 645-652; 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 757. The court saw "no indication that the Legislature looked to see whether any discriminatory taint remained in the plans." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649. And it faulted the State because it "did not accept [findings of the D. C. court] and instead appealed to the Supreme Court." Ibid. Seeing no evidence that the State had undergone "a change of heart," the court concluded that the Legislature's "decision to adopt the [District Court's] plans" was a "litigation strategy designed to insulate the 2011 or 2013 plans from further challenge, regardless of their legal infirmities." Id., at 649-650. Finally, summarizing its analysis, the court
   reiterated that the 2011 Legislature's "discriminatory taint was not removed by the [2013] Legislature's enactment of the Court's interim plans, because the Legislature engaged in no deliberative process to remove any such taint, and in fact intended any such taint to be maintained but be safe from remedy." Id., at 686.

   The Texas court's decisions about CD35 and all but three of the Texas House districts were based entirely on its finding that the 2013 Legislature had not purged its predecessor's discriminatory intent. However, the court also held that three districts--CD27, HD32, and HD34--were invalid under §2 of the Voting Rights Act because they had the effect of depriving Latinos of the equal opportunity to elect their candidates of choice. Id., at 682-686; 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 775-783. And the court found independent proof that HD90 was a racial gerrymander. Id., at 788-794.

   The court held that violations in all these districts "must be remedied." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 686; see also 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 795 (describing State House district violations that "must be remedied"). Mindful that October 1 was the deadline for the Texas Secretary of State to provide voter registration templates to the State's counties, App. 380a-381a, the court took steps to bring about prompt remedial action. In two orders issued on August 15 and 24, the Texas attorney general was instructed to advise the court, within three days, "whether the Legislature intends to take up redistricting in an effort to cure these violations." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 686; 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 795. If the Legislature chose not to do so, the court warned, it would "hold a hearing to consider remedial plans." Ibid. After the Governor made clear that the State would not act, the court ordered the parties to proceed with a hearing on the congressional plan on September 5, as well as a hearing on the plan for the
   Texas House on September 6. 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 686; 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 795; App. 134a-136a; Defendants' Opposed Motion To Stay Order on Plan C235 Pending Appeal or Final Judgment in Civ. No. 11-cv-00360, Doc. 1538, pp. 3-4; Defendants' Opposed Motion To Stay Order on Plan H358 Pending Appeal or Final Judgment, Doc. No. 1550, pp. 4-5.

   Texas applied for stays of both orders, but the District Court denied the applications. App. 134a-136a. Texas then asked this Court to stay the orders, and we granted that relief. After receiving jurisdictional statements, we postponed consideration of jurisdiction and set the cases for consolidated argument. 583 U. S. ___ (2018).


   Before reaching the merits of these appeals, we must assure ourselves that we have jurisdiction to review the orders at issue. Appellants claim that the orders amount to injunctions and are therefore appealable to this Court under 28 U. S. C. §1253. Appellees disagree, contending that the orders do not qualify as injunctions. We hold that we have jurisdiction because the orders were effectively injunctions in that they barred Texas from using the districting plans now in effect to conduct this year's elections.

   A

   The Judiciary Act of 1789, 1Stat. 73, "established the general principle that only final decisions of the federal district courts would be reviewable on appeal." Carson v. American Brands, Inc., 450 U. S. 79, 83 (1981) (emphasis deleted). But because "rigid application of this principle was found to create undue hardship in some cases," Congress created exceptions. Ibid. Two are relevant here. We have jurisdiction under 28 U. S. C. §1253 to hear an appeal from an order of a three-judge district court "granting or denying . . . an interlocutory or permanent injunction." Similarly, §1292(a)(1) gives the courts of appeals jurisdiction over "[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts" "granting, continuing, modifying, refusing or dissolving injunctions," "except where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court."

   The orders in these cases fall within §1253. To be sure, the District Court did not call its orders "injunctions"--in fact, it disclaimed the term, App. 134a-136a--but the label attached to an order is not dispositive. We have previously made clear that where an order has the "practical effect" of granting or denying an injunction, it should be treated as such for purposes of appellate jurisdiction. Carson, supra, at 83; see also Gulfstream Aerospace Corp. v. Mayacamas Corp., 485 U. S. 271, 287-288 (1988). We applied this test in Carson, holding that an order that declined to enter a consent decree prohibiting certain conduct could be appealed under §1292(a)(1) because it was the practical equivalent of an order denying an injunction and threatened serious and perhaps irreparable harm if not immediately reviewed. 450 U. S., at 83-84, 86-90.

   This "practical effect" rule serves a valuable purpose. If an interlocutory injunction is improperly granted or denied, much harm can occur before the final decision in the district court. Lawful and important conduct may be barred, and unlawful and harmful conduct may be allowed to continue. Recognizing this, Congress authorized interlocutory appellate review of such orders. But if the availability of interlocutory review depended on the district court's use of the term "injunction" or some other particular language, Congress's scheme could be frustrated. The harms that Congress wanted to avoid could occur so long as the district court was careful about its terminology. The "practical effect" inquiry prevents such manipulation.

   In analogous contexts, we have not allowed district courts to "shield [their] orders from appellate review" by avoiding the label "injunction." Sampson v. Murray, 415 U. S. 61, 87 (1974). For instance, in Sampson, we held that an order labeled a temporary restraining order (which is not appealable under §1292(a)(1)) should be treated as a "preliminary injunction" (which is appealable) since the order had the same practical effect as a preliminary injunction. Id., at 86-88.

   Appellees and the dissent contend that the "practical effect" approach should be confined to §1292(a)(1), but we see no good reason why it should not apply to §1253 as well. Appellees note that we "narrowly constru[e]" §1253, Goldstein v. Cox, 396 U. S. 471, 478 (1970), but we also construe §1292(a)(1) "narrowly," Carson, supra, at 84. In addition, the relevant language in the two provisions is nearly identical;[10] both provisions serve the same purpose; and we have previously called them "analogous." Goldstein, supra, at 475.

   The provisions are also textually interlocked. Section 1292(a)(1) does not apply where "direct review may be had in the Supreme Court," i.e., where §1253 applies. If the "practical effects" test applied under §1292(a)(1) but not §1253, the consequences would be unfortunate and strange. We would have to identify the magic language needed for an order to qualify as an order granting or denying an injunction, and that standard would hardly constitute the sort of "[s]imple" rule that the dissent prizes. See post, at 14 (opinion of Sotomayor, J.). Then, having developed that standard, we would have to apply it in any case in which a party took an appeal to us from an order of a three-judge court that clearly had the practical effect of an injunction. If we concluded that the magic-words test was not met, the order would appear to be appealable to one of the courts of appeals under §1292(a)(1). In the language of that provision, the order would be an "orde[r] of [a] district cour[t] of the United
   States . . . granting [an] injunctio[n]." And because this Court would lack jurisdiction under §1253, the appeal would not fall within §1292(1)'s exception for cases "where a direct review may be had in the Supreme Court." Having taken pains to provide for review in this Court, and not in the courts of appeals, of three-judge court orders granting injunctions Congress surely did not intend to produce that result.[11]

   Appellees argue that an order denying an injunction (the situation in Carson) and an order granting an injunction (the situation here) should be treated differently, Brief for Appellees in No. 17-586, p. 27, but they offer no convincing reason for doing so. No authority supports their argument. The language of §§1253 and 1292(a)(1) makes no such distinction, and we have stated that the "practical effect" analysis applies to the "granting or denying" of injunctions. Gulfstream, supra, at 287-288.

   In addition, appellees' suggested distinction would put appellate courts in an awkward position. Suppose that a district court granted an injunction that was narrower than the one requested by the moving party. Would an appellate court (whether this Court or a court of appeals) have jurisdiction to rule on only part of that decision? Suppose the appellate court concluded that the district court was correct in refusing to give the movant all the injunctive relief it sought because the movant's entire claim was doomed to fail. Would the appellate court be limited to holding only that the lower court properly denied the relief that was withheld? The rule advocated by the appellees would needlessly complicate appellate review.[12]

   Finally, appellees point in passing to Rule 65(d) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, which requires that an injunction "state its terms specifically" and "describe in reasonable detail . . . the act or acts restrained or required." Rules 65(d)(1)(B), (C); see Brief for Appellees in No. 17-586, at 27. But as explained in Gunn v. University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam, 399 U. S. 383, 389, n. 4 (1970), we have never suggested that a failure to meet the specificity requirements of Rule 65(d) would "deprive the Court of jurisdiction under §1253."

   A contrary holding would be perverse. Rule 65(b) protects the party against which an injunction is issued by requiring clear notice as to what that party must do or refrain from doing. Where a vague injunction does not comply with Rule 65(b), the aggrieved party has a particularly strong need for appellate review. It would be odd to hold that there can be no appeal in such a circumstance.

   For these reasons, we hold that we have jurisdiction under §1253 to hear an appeal from an order that has the same practical effect as one granting or denying an injunction.

   B

   With these principles settled, we conclude that the orders in these cases qualify as interlocutory injunctions under §1253. The text of the orders and the context in which they were issued make this clear.

   The orders are unequivocal that the current legislative plans "violate §2 and the Fourteenth Amendment" and that these violations "must be remedied." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 686; see also, e.g., 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 795 ("[V]iolations found by this Court in its Order on [the State House plan] now require a remedy"); ibid. ("In Bell County, the intentional discrimination previously found by the Court must be remedied"); ibid. ("In Dallas County, the intentional discrimination previously found by the Court must be remedied").

   We do not suggest that this language alone is sufficient to show that the orders had the practical effect of enjoining use of the current plans in this year's elections, but the court did not stop with these pronouncements. As we have noted, the orders required the Texas attorney general to inform the court within three days whether the Legislature would remedy the violations, and the orders stated that if the Legislature did not intend to adopt new plans, the court would hold remedial hearings.

   The short time given the Legislature to respond is strong evidence that the three-judge court did not intend to allow the elections to go ahead under the plans it had just condemned. The Legislature was not in session, so in order to take up the task of redistricting, the Governor would have been required to convene a special session--which is no small matter. And, when the Governor declined to call a special session, the court moved ahead with its scheduled hearings and invited the parties to continue preparing for them even after this Court administratively stayed the August 15 order.

   The import of these actions is unmistakable: The court intended to have new plans ready for use in this year's elections. Nothing in the record even hints that the court contemplated the possibility of allowing the elections to proceed under the 2013 plans.

   What is more, Texas had reason to believe that it would risk deleterious consequences if it defied the court and attempted to conduct the elections under the plans that the court had found to be based on intentional racial discrimination. In the very orders at issue, the court inferred discriminatory intent from Texas's choice to appeal the D. C. court's preclearance decision rather than immediately taking steps to bring its plans into compliance with that decision. 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649; see Part III, infra. Reading such an order, Texas had reason to fear that if it tried to conduct elections under plans that the court had found to be racially discriminatory, the court would infer an evil motive and perhaps subject the State once again to the strictures of preclearance under §3(c) of the Voting Rights Act.[13] This is a remedy that the plaintiffs hoped to obtain, see, e.g., App. 177a, and that the District Court seemed inclined to consider, see C. J. S. 122a-123a (declining to declare
   moot the challenges to the long-since-repealed 2011 plans because "there remains the possibility of declaratory and equitable relief under §3(c)").

   Contending that the orders here do not qualify under §1253, appellees analogize this case to Gunn, 399 U. S. 383, but there is no relevant similarity. In Gunn, anti-war protesters were charged with violating a Texas "disturbing-the-peace statute," id., at 384, and they challenged the constitutionality of the statute in federal court. After the state charges were dismissed, the District Court issued a "discursive" opinion "expressing the view that [the statute was] constitutionally invalid." Id., at 386-387. But the court then refrained from going any further, "pending the next session, special or general, of the Texas legislature, at which time the State of Texas may, if it so desires, enact such disturbing-the-peace statute as will meet constitutional requirements." University Comm. to End War in Viet Nam v. Gunn, 289 F. Supp. 469, 475 (WD Tex. 1968). The defendants appealed to this Court, and at the time of our decision two years later, neither the Legislature nor the District Court had
   taken any further action. We therefore held that we lacked jurisdiction under §1253. The District Court order in that case did not have the same practical effect as an injunction. Indeed, it had no practical effect whatsoever and is thus entirely different from the orders now before us.[14]

   Appellees suggest that appellate jurisdiction is lacking in this case because we do not know at this point "what a remedy would entail, who it would affect, and when it would be implemented." Brief for Appellees in No. 17-586, at 27. The dissent makes a similar argument with respect to two of the Texas House districts. Post, at 13-14.[15] But the issue here is whether this year's elections can be held under the plans enacted by the Legislature, not whether any particular remedies would have ulti- mately been ordered by the District Court.

   Appellees and the dissent also fret that this Court will be inundated with redistricting appeals if we accept jurisdiction here, Brief for Appellees in No. 17-626, p. 34; post, at 15-16, and n. 8, but there is no reason to fear such a flood. Because §1253 expressly authorizes "interlocutory" appeals, there is no question that there can be more than one appeal in a case challenging a redistricting plan. District courts sometimes expressly enjoin the use of districting plans before moving on to the remedial phase. See, e.g., Whitford v. Gill, No. 3:15-cv-421, Doc. No. 190 (WD Wis., Feb. 22, 2017); Harris v. McCrory, No. 1:13-cv-949, Doc. No. 143 (MDNC, Feb. 5, 2016). But appeals from such orders have not overwhelmed our docket. Our holding here will affect only a small category of additional cases.[16]

   It should go without saying that our decision does not mean that a State can always appeal a district court order holding a redistricting plan unlawful. A finding on liability cannot be appealed unless an injunction is granted or denied, and in some cases a district court may see no need for interlocutory relief. If a plan is found to be unlawful long before the next scheduled election, a court may defer any injunctive relief until the case is completed. And if a plan is found to be unlawful very close to the election date, the only reasonable option may be to use the plan one last time.

   We appreciate our obligation to heed the limits of our jurisdiction, and we reiterate that §1253 must be strictly construed. But it also must be sensibly construed, and here the District Court's orders, for all intents and purposes, constituted injunctions barring the State from conducting this year's elections pursuant to a statute enacted by the Legislature. Unless that statute is unconstitutional, this would seriously and irreparably harm[17] the State, and only an interlocutory appeal can protect that State interest. See Carson, supra, at 89-90. As a result, §1253 provides jurisdiction.


   We now turn to the merits of the appeal. The primary question is whether the Texas court erred when it required the State to show that the 2013 Legislature somehow purged the "taint" that the court attributed to the defunct and never-used plans enacted by a prior legislature in 2011.

   A

   Whenever a challenger claims that a state law was enacted with discriminatory intent, the burden of proof lies with the challenger, not the State. Reno v. Bossier Parish School Bd., 520 U. S. 471, 481 (1997). This rule takes on special significance in districting cases.

   Redistricting "is primarily the duty and responsibility of the State," and "[f]ederal-court review of districting legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local functions." Miller v. Johnson, 515 U. S. 900, 915 (1995) (internal quotation marks omitted). "[I]n assessing the sufficiency of a challenge to a districting plan," a court "must be sensitive to the complex interplay of forces that enter a legislature's redistricting calculus." Id., at 915-916. And the "good faith of [the] state legislature must be presumed." Id., at 915.

   The allocation of the burden of proof and the presumption of legislative good faith are not changed by a finding of past discrimination. "[P]ast discrimination cannot, in the manner of original sin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlawful." Mobile, 446 U. S., at 74 (plurality opinion). The "ultimate question remains whether a discriminatory intent has been proved in a given case." Ibid. The "historical background" of a legislative enactment is "one evidentiary source" relevant to the question of intent. Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan Housing Development Corp., 429 U. S. 252, 267 (1977). But we have never suggested that past discrimination flips the evidentiary burden on its head.

   Neither the District Court nor appellees have pointed to any authority that would justify shifting the burden. The appellees rely primarily on Hunter v. Underwood, 471 U. S. 222 (1985), but that case addressed a very different situation. Hunter involved an equal protection challenge to an article of the Alabama Constitution adopted in 1901 at a constitutional convention avowedly dedicated to the establishment of white supremacy. Id., at 228-230. The article disenfranchised anyone convicted of any crime on a long list that included many minor offenses. Id., at 226-227. The court below found that the article had been adopted with discriminatory intent, and this Court accepted that conclusion. Id., at 229. The article was never repealed, but over the years, the list of disqualifying offenses had been pruned, and the State argued that what remained was facially constitutional. Id., at 232-233. This Court rejected that argument because the amendments did not alter the intent with which the
   article, including the parts that remained, had been adopted. Id., at 233. But the Court specifically declined to address the question whether the then-existing version would have been valid if "[re]enacted today." Ibid.

   In these cases, we do not confront a situation like the one in Hunter. Nor is this a case in which a law originally enacted with discriminatory intent is later reenacted by a different legislature. The 2013 Texas Legislature did not reenact the plan previously passed by its 2011 predecessor. Nor did it use criteria that arguably carried forward the effects of any discriminatory intent on the part of the 2011 Legislature. Instead, it enacted, with only very small changes, plans that had been developed by the Texas court pursuant to instructions from this Court "not to incorporate . . . any legal defects." Perry, 565 U. S., at 394.

   Under these circumstances, there can be no doubt about what matters: It is the intent of the 2013 Legislature. And it was the plaintiffs' burden to overcome the presumption of legislative good faith and show that the 2013 Legislature acted with invidious intent.

   The Texas court contravened these basic principles. Instead of holding the plaintiffs to their burden of overcoming the presumption of good faith and proving discriminatory intent, it reversed the burden of proof. It imposed on the State the obligation of proving that the 2013 Legislature had experienced a true "change of heart" and had "engage[d] in a deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649.

   The Texas court's references to the need to "cure" the earlier Legislature's "taint" cannot be dismissed as stray comments. On the contrary, they were central to the court's analysis. The court referred repeatedly to the 2013 Legislature's duty to expiate its predecessor's bad intent, and when the court summarized its analysis, it drove the point home. It stated: "The discriminatory taint [from the 2011 plans] was not removed by the Legislature's enactment of the Court's interim plans, because the Legislature engaged in no deliberative process to remove any such taint, and in fact intended any such taint to be maintained but be safe from remedy." Id., at 686.[18]

   The dissent labors to explain away all these references to the 2013's Legislature's supposed duty to purge its predecessor's allegedly discriminatory intent, but the dissent loses track of its own argument and characterizes the District Court's reasoning exactly as we have. Indeed, the dissent criticizes us on page 33 of its opinion for saying precisely the same thing that it said 11 pages earlier. On page 33, the dissent states:

   "[T]he majority quotes the orders as requiring proof that the Legislature " `engage[d] in a deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans.' " But the District Court did not put the burden on Texas to make that affirmative showing." Post, at 33-34 (quoting supra, at 23, in turn quoting 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649; citations omitted).

   But earlier, the dissent itself describes the District Court's analysis as follows:

   "Despite knowing of the discrimination in its 2011 maps, `the Legislature did not engage in a deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans.' " Post, at 22 (quoting 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649).

   And this is not just a single slip of the pen. The dissent writes that the District Court was required "to assess how the 2013 Legislature addressed the known discrimination that motivated" the districts approved by that Court in 2012. Post, at 31. The dissent quotes the District Court's statement that " `there is no indication that the Legislature looked to see whether any discriminatory taint remained in the plans.' " Post, at 24 (quoting 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649). And there is also this: "Texas was just `not truly interested in fixing any remaining discrimination in [its 2011 maps].' " Post, at 22 (quoting 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 651, n. 45). The District Court's true mode of analysis is so obvious that the dissent cannot help but repeat it. And that approach was fundamentally flawed and demands reversal.

   While a district court's finding of fact on the question of discriminatory intent is reviewed for clear error, see Cromartie, 532 U. S., at 242, whether the court applied the correct burden of proof is a question of law subject to plenary review, U. S. Bank N. A. v. Village at Lakeridge, LLC, 583 U. S. ___, ___ (2018) (slip op., at 5); Highmark Inc. v. Allcare Health Management System, Inc., 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014) (slip op., at 4). And when a finding of fact is based on the application of an incorrect burden of proof, the finding cannot stand. Bose Corp. v. Consumers Union of United States, Inc., 466 U. S. 485, 501 (1984) ("An appellate cour[t has] power to correct errors of law, including those that . . . infect . . . a finding of fact that is predicated on a misunderstanding of the governing rule of law").

   B

   In holding that the District Court disregarded the presumption of legislative good faith and improperly reversed the burden of proof, we do not suggest either that the intent of the 2011 Legislature is irrelevant or that the plans enacted in 2013 are unassailable because they were previously adopted on an interim basis by the Texas court. Rather, both the intent of the 2011 Legislature and the court's adoption of the interim plans are relevant to the extent that they naturally give rise to--or tend to refute--inferences regarding the intent of the 2013 Legislature. They must be weighed together with any other direct and circumstantial evidence of that Legislature's intent. But when all the relevant evidence in the record is taken into account, it is plainly insufficient to prove that the 2013 Legislature acted in bad faith and engaged in intentional discrimination.[19] See, e.g., Ricci v. DeStefano, 557 U. S. 557, 585 (2009); McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U. S. 467, 497 (1991). There is thus no
   need for any further prolongation of this already protracted litigation.

   The only direct evidence brought to our attention suggests that the 2013 Legislature's intent was legitimate. It wanted to bring the litigation about the State's districting plans to an end as expeditiously as possible. The attorney general advised the Legislature that the best way to do this was to adopt the interim, court-issued plans. The sponsor of the 2013 plans voiced the same objective, and the Legislature then adopted the court-approved plans.

   On its face, this explanation of the Legislature's intent is entirely reasonable and certainly legitimate. The Legislature had reason to know that any new plans it devised were likely to be attacked by one group of plaintiffs or another. (The plaintiffs' conflicting positions with regard to some of the districts in the plans now before us bear this out.) Litigating districting cases is expensive and time consuming, and until the districts to be used in the next election are firmly established, a degree of uncertainty clouds the electoral process. Wishing to minimize these effects is understandable and proper.

   The court below discounted this direct evidence, but its reasons for doing so are not sound. The court stated that the "strategy" of the 2013 Legislature was to "insulate [the plans] from further challenge, regardless of [the plans'] legal infirmities." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 650; see also id., at 651, n. 45. But there is no evidence that the Legislature's aim was to gain acceptance of plans that it knew were unlawful.[20] Indeed, there is no evidence that the Legislature thought that the plans were invalid--and as we will explain, the Legislature had sound reasons to believe just the opposite.[21]

   The District Court found it significant that the Legislature must have realized that enacting the interim plans would not "end the litigation," because it knew that at least some plaintiffs would pursue their challenges anyway. Id., at 651, n. 45. But even if, as seems likely, the Legislature did not think that all the plaintiffs would immediately abandon all their claims, it does not follow that the Legislature was insincere in stating that it adopted the court-approved plan with the aim of bringing the litigation to a close. It was reasonable for the Legislature to think that approving the court-approved plans might at least reduce objections and thus simplify and expedite the conclusion of the litigation.[22] That MALDEF, counsel for one of the plaintiff groups, testified in favor of the plans is evidence that the Legislature's objective was reasonable. C. J. S. 436a-439a.

   Not only does the direct evidence suggest that the 2013 Legislature lacked discriminatory intent, but the circumstantial evidence points overwhelmingly to the same conclusion. Consider the situation when the Legislature adopted the court-approved interim plans. First, the Texas court had adopted those plans, and no one would claim that the court acted with invidious intent when it did so. Second, the Texas court approved those plans only after reviewing them and modifying them as required to comply with our instructions. Not one of the judges on that court expressed the view that the plans were unlawful. Third, we had directed the Texas court to make changes in response to any claims under the Equal Protection Clause and §2 of the Voting Rights Act if those claims were merely likely to prevail. Perry, 565 U. S., at 394. And the Texas court was told to accommodate any claim under §5 of the VRA unless it was "insubstantial." Id., at 395. Fourth, the Texas court had made a careful analysis of
   all the claims, had provided a detailed examination of individual districts, and had modified many districts. Its work was anything but slapdash. All these facts gave the Legislature good reason to believe that the court-approved interim plans were legally sound.

   Is there any evidence from which a contrary inference can reasonably be drawn? Appellees stress the preliminary nature of the Texas court's approval of the interim plans, and as we have said, that fact is relevant. But in light of our instructions to the Texas court and the care with which the interim plans were developed, the court's approval still gave the Legislature a sound basis for thinking that the interim plans satisfied all legal requirements.

   The court below and the dissent infer bad faith because the Legislature "pushed the redistricting bills through quickly in a special session." 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649. But we do not see how the brevity of the legislative process can give rise to an inference of bad faith--and certainly not an inference that is strong enough to overcome the presumption of legislative good faith (a concept to which the dissent pays only the briefest lip service, post, at 21). The "special session" was necessary because the regular session had ended. As explained, the Legislature had good reason to believe that the interim plans were sound, and the adoption of those already-completed plans did not require a prolonged process. After all, part of the reason for adopting those plans was to avoid the time and expense of starting from scratch and leaving the electoral process in limbo while that occurred.[23]

   The District Court and the dissent also err when they charge that Representative Darby, the chair of the Texas House Redistricting Committee at the time in question, " `willfully ignored those who pointed out deficiencies' " in the plans. Post, at 23 (quoting 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 651, n. 45). This accusation is not only misleading, it misses the point. The Legislature adopted the interim plans in large part because they had the preliminary approval of the District Court, and Darby was open about the fact that he wanted to minimize amendments to the plans for that reason. See, e.g., Joint Exh. 17.3, pp. S1-S2. That Darby generally hoped to minimize amendments--so that the plans would remain legally compliant--hardly shows that he, or the Legislature, acted with discriminatory intent. In any event, it is misleading to characterize this attitude as "willfu[l] ignor[ance]." The record shows that, al- though Darby hoped to minimize amendments, he did not categorically refuse to consider changes.
   This is illustrated by his support for an amendment to HD90, which was offered by the then-incumbent, Democrat Lon Burnam, precisely because it fixed an objection raised by the Mexican-American Legal Caucus (MALC) that the district's Latino population was too low. 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 790.[24]

   The Texas court faulted the 2013 Legislature for failing to take into account the problems with the 2011 plans that the D. C. court identified in denying preclearance, ibid., but the basis for that criticism is hard to understand. One of the 2013 Legislature's principal reasons for adopting the court-approved plans was to fix the problems identified by the D. C. court. The attorney general advised the Legislature to adopt the interim plans because he thought that was the "best way to remedy the violations found by the D. C. court." C. J. S. 432a. Chairman Darby similarly stated that the 2013 plans fixed the errors found by the D. C. court, Tr. 1498, 1584-1585 (July 14, 2017), as did Senator Seliger, Joint Exh. 26.2, p. A-5.

   There is nothing to suggest that the Legislature proceeded in bad faith--or even that it acted unreasonably--in pursuing this strategy. Recall that we instructed the Texas court, in developing the interim plans, to remedy any §5 claim that was "not insubstantial." Perry, 565 U. S., at 395. And that is just what the interim plans, which the Legislature later enacted, attempted to do. For instance, the D. C. court held that the congressional plan had one too few "ability to elect" districts for Latinos, largely because of changes to CD23, Texas, 887 F. Supp. 2d, at 156-159; the interim plan (and, by extension, the 2013 plan) amended CD23, C. J. S. 397a-399a. Similarly, in the plan for the Texas House, the D. C. court found §5 retrogression with respect to HD35, HD117, and HD149, Texas, supra, at 167-175, and all of those districts were changed in the 2013 plans, H. J. S. 305a-307a, 312a.

   Although the D. C. court found that the 2011 Legislature acted with discriminatory intent in framing the congressional plan, that finding was based on evidence about districts that the interim plan later changed. The D. C. court was concerned about the intent reflected in the drawing of CDs 9, 18, and 30, but all those districts were amended by the Texas court. Texas, supra, at 159-160; C. J. S. 406a-408a. With respect to the plan for the Texas House, the D. C. court made no intent findings, but its areas of concern were generally addressed by the Texas court and the 2013 plans. Compare Texas, supra, at 178 (noting evidence of unlawful intent in HD117), with H. J. S. 307a (amending HD117).[25]

   It is indicative of the District Court's mistaken approach that it inferred bad faith from Texas's decision to take an appeal to this Court from the D. C. court's decision denying preclearance. See 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 649 ("Defendants did not accept [these findings] and instead appealed to the Supreme Court"). Congress gave the State the right to appeal, and no bad motive can be inferred from its decision to make use of this right--unless of course the State had no reasonable grounds for appeal. Before our decision in Shelby County mooted Texas's appeal to this Court from the D. C. court's preclearance decision, Texas filed a jurisdictional statement claiming that the D. C. court made numerous errors, but the Texas court made no attempt to show that Texas's arguments were frivolous.

   As a final note, appellees assert that the 2013 Legislature should have either defended the 2011 plans in litigation or gone back to the drawing board and devised en- tirely new plans, Brief for Appellees in No. 17-626, at 45, but there is no reason why the Legislature's options should be limited in this way. It was entirely permissible for the Legislature to favor a legitimate option that promised to simplify and reduce the burden of litigation. That the Legislature chose this course is not proof of discriminatory intent.

   IV

   Once the Texas court's intent finding is reversed, there remain only four districts that were invalidated on alternative grounds. For three of these districts, the District Court relied on the "effects" test of §2. We reverse as to each of these, but we affirm the District Court's final holding that HD90 is a racial gerrymander.

   A

   To make out a §2 "effects" claim, a plaintiff must establish the three so-called "Gingles factors." These are (1) a geographically compact minority population sufficient to constitute a majority in a single-member district, (2) political cohesion among the members of the minority group, and (3) bloc voting by the majority to defeat the minority's preferred candidate. Gingles, 478 U. S., at 48-51; LULAC, 548 U. S., at 425. If a plaintiff makes that showing, it must then go on to prove that, under the totality of the circumstances, the district lines dilute the votes of the members of the minority group. Id., at 425-426.


   The Texas court held that CD27 violates §2 of the VRA because it has the effect of diluting the votes of Latino voters in Nueces County. C. J. S. 191a. CD27 is anchored in Nueces County (home to Corpus Christi) and follows the Gulf of Mexico to the northeast before taking a turn inland to the northwest in the direction of Austin. Nueces County contains a Latino population of roughly 200,000 (a little less than one-third the size of an ideal Texas congressional district), and the court held that the Nueces County Latinos should have been included in a Latino opportunity district, rather than CD27, which is not such a district. The court found that an area centered on Nueces County satisfies the Gingles factors and that, under the totality of the circumstances, the placement of the Nueces County Latinos in CD27 deprives them of the equal opportunity to elect candidates of their choice. C. J. S. 181a-195a.

   The problem with this holding is that plaintiffs could not establish a violation of §2 of the VRA without showing that there is a " `possibility of creating more than the existing number of reasonably compact' " opportunity districts. LULAC, supra, at 430. And as the Texas court itself found, the geography and demographics of south and west Texas do not permit the creation of any more than the seven Latino opportunity districts that exist under the current plan. 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 684, and n. 85.

   Attempting to get around this problem, the Texas court relied on our decision in LULAC, but it misapplied our holding. In LULAC, we held that the State should have created six proper Latino opportunity districts but instead drew only five. 548 U. S., at 435. Although the State claimed that the plan actually included a sixth opportunity district, that district failed to satisfy the Gingles factors. 548 U. S., at 430. We held that a "State's creation of an opportunity district for those without a §2 right offers no excuse for its failure to provide an opportunity district for those with a §2 right." Ibid.

   Here, the Texas court concluded that Texas committed the same violation as in LULAC: It created "an opportu-nity district for those without a §2 right" (the Latinos in CD35), while failing to create such a district "for those with a §2 right" (the Latinos of Nueces County). Ibid. This holding is based on a flawed analysis of CD35.

   CD35 lies to the north of CD27 and runs along I-35 from San Antonio up to Austin, the center of Travis County. In the District Court's view, the Latinos of CD35 do not have a §2 right because one of the Gingles factors, majority bloc voting, is not present. The Court reached this conclusion because the non-Latino voters of Travis County tend to favor the same candidates as the great majority of Latinos. There are two serious problems with the District Court's analysis.

   First, the Court took the wrong approach in evaluating the presence of majority bloc voting in CD35. The Court looked at only one, small part of the district, the portion that falls within Travis County. 274 F. Supp. 3d, at 683; C. J. S. 175a-176a. But Travis County makes up only 21% of the district. We have made clear that redistricting analysis must take place at the district level. Bethune-Hill, 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 12). In failing to perform that district-level analysis, the District Court went astray.

   Second, here, unlike in LULAC, the 2013 Legislature had "good reasons" to believe that the district at issue (here CD35) was a viable Latino opportunity district that satisfied the Gingles factors. CD35 was based on a concept proposed by MALDEF, C. J. S. Findings 315a-316a, and the Latino Redistricting Task Force (a plaintiff group) argued that the district is mandated by §2. C. J. S. 174a. The only Gingles factor disputed by the court was majority bloc voting, and there is ample evidence that this factor is met. Indeed, the court found that majority bloc voting exists throughout the State. C. J. S. Findings 467a. In addition, the District Court extensively analyzed CD35 in 2012 and determined that it was likely not a racial gerrymander and that even if it was, it likely satisfied strict scrutiny. C. J. S. 415a. In other words, the 2013 Legislature justifiably thought that it had placed a viable opportunity district along the I-35 corridor.


   The District Court similarly erred in holding that HD32 and HD34 violate §2. These districts make up the entirety of Nueces County, which has a population that is almost exactly equal to twice the population of an ideal Texas House district. (It can fit 2.0295 ideal districts. H. J. S. Findings 91a.) In 2010, Latinos made up approximately 56% of the voting age population of the county. Ibid. The 2013 plan created two districts that lie wholly within the county; one, HD34, is a Latino opportunity district, but the other, HD32, is not. 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 767.

   Findings made by the court below show that these two districts do not violate §2 of the Voting Rights Act. Under Gingles, the ultimate question is whether a districting decision dilutes the votes of minority voters, see LULAC, supra, at 425-426, and it is hard to see how this standard could be met if the alternative to the districting decision at issue would not enhance the ability of minority voters to elect the candidates of their choice.

   The only plaintiff that pressed a §2 claim with respect to HD32 and HD34 was MALC, 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 767, and as the District Court recognized, that group's own expert determined that it was not possible to divide Nueces County into more than one performing Latino district. In his analysis, the expert relied on Nueces County election returns for statewide elections between 2010 and 2016. Id., at 775-776. Based on this data, he calculated that when both HD32 and HD34 were maintained as Latino-majority districts, one performed for Latinos in only 7 out of 35 relevant elections, and the other did so in none of the 35 elections. Ibid. In order to create two performing districts in that area, it was necessary, he found, to break county lines in multiple places, id., at 778, but the District Court held that "breaking the County Line Rule" in the Texas Constitution, see Art. III, §26, to "remove Anglos and incorporate even more Hispanics to improve electoral outcomes goes beyond what §2
   requires." 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 783. So if Texas could not create two performing districts in Nueces County and did not have to break county lines, the logical result is that Texas did not dilute the Latino vote.

   The court refused to accept this conclusion, but its reasons for doing so cannot stand up. As an initial matter, the court thought that the two districts would have to be redrawn based on its finding regarding the intent of the 2013 Legislature,[26] and it therefore deferred a final decision on the §2 issue and advised the plaintiffs to consider at the remedial phase of the case whether they preferred to have two districts that might not perform or just one safe district. Id., at 783. The court's decision cannot be sustained on this ground, since its finding of discriminatory intent is erroneous.

   The only other reason provided by the court was the observation that MALC "failed to show" that two majority-Latino districts in Nueces County would not perform. Id., at 782. This observation twisted the burden of proof beyond recognition. It suggested that a plaintiff might succeed on its §2 claim because its expert failed to show that the necessary factual basis for the claim could not be established.[27] Courts cannot find §2 effects violations on the basis of uncertainty. In any event, if even the District Court remains unsure how to draw these districts to comply with §2 (after six years of litigation, almost a dozen trials, and numerous opinions), the Legislature surely had the " `broad discretion' " to comply as it reasonably saw fit in 2013, LULAC, supra, at 429.

   The dissent charges us with ignoring the District Court's " `intensely local appraisal" ' of Nueces County, post, at 44, but almost none of the "findings" that the District Court made with respect to HD32 and HD34 referred to present local conditions, and none cast any significant light on the question whether another opportunity district is possible at the present time. For instance, what the dissent describes as Texas's "long `history of voting-related discrimination,' " ibid., in no way undermines--or even has any logical bearing on--the conclusions reached by MALC's expert about whether Latino voters would have a real opportunity to elect the candidates of their choice if the county was divided into two districts with narrow majorities of Latino citizens of voting age. The same is true with respect to the District Court's findings regarding racially polarized voting in the county and Latinos' "continuing pattern of disadvantage relative to" non-Latinos. 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 779 (internal
   quotation marks omitted). Perhaps recognizing as much, both the District Court and the dissent point to the anticipated future growth in the percentage of eligible voters of Latino descent, but the districts now at issue would not necessar-ily be used beyond 2020, after which time the 2020 census would likely require redistricting once again.

   HD90 is a district in Tarrant County that, unlike the other districts at issue in this appeal, was not copied from the District Court's interim plans. Instead, the 2013 Legislature substantially modified the district developed by the District Court, and the District Court held that the 2013 Legislature's creation is an invalid racial gerrymander. 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 794.

   In drawing HD90, the Legislature was pulled in opposite directions by competing groups. In 2011, the Legislature, responding to pressure from MALDEF, increased the Latino population of the district in an effort to make it a Latino opportunity district. H. J. S. Findings 258a-262a. In the process of doing so, the Legislature moved the community of Como, which is predominantly African-American, out of the district. But Como residents and the member of the Texas House who represented the district, Lon Burnam, objected, and in 2013, the Legislature moved Como back into the district. 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 788-789. That change was opposed by MALC because it decreased the Latino population below 50%. App. 398a-399a. So the Legislature moved Latinos into the district to bring the Latino population back above 50%. 267 F. Supp. 3d, at 789-790.

   In light of these maneuvers, Texas does not dispute that race was the predominant factor in the design of HD90, but it argues that this was permissible because it had " `good reasons to believe' " that this was necessary to satisfy §2 of the Voting Rights Act." Bethune-Hill, 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 14).

   Texas offers two pieces of evidence to support its claim. The first--that one of the plaintiffs, MALC, demanded as much--is insufficient. A group that wants a State to create a district with a particular design may come to have an overly expansive understanding of what §2 demands. So one group's demands alone cannot be enough.

   The other item of evidence consists of the results of the Democratic primaries in 2012 and 2014. In 2012, Representative Burnham, who was not the Latino candidate of choice, narrowly defeated a Latino challenger by 159 votes. And in 2014, the present representative, Ramon Romero, Jr., beat Burnam by 110 votes. See Brief for Appellants 70. These election returns may be suggestive, but standing alone, they were not enough to give the State good reason to conclude that it had to alter the district's lines solely on the basis of race. And putting these two evidentiary items together helps, but it is simply too thin a reed to support the drastic decision to draw lines in this way.

   We have previously rejected proffers of evidence that were at least as strong as Texas's here. For example, in Cooper, 581 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 11), we analyzed North Carolina's justification for deliberately moving "African-American voters" into a district to "ensure . . . the district's racial composition" in the face of its expansion in size. North Carolina argued that its race-based decisions were necessary to comply with §2, but the State could point to "no meaningful legislative inquiry" into "whether a new, enlarged" district, "created without a focus on race, . . . could lead to §2 liability." Id., at ___ (slip op., at 15). North Carolina pointed to two expert reports on "voting patterns throughout the State," but we rejected that evidence as insufficient. Id., at ___, n. 5 (slip op., at 15, n. 5). Here, Texas has pointed to no actual "legislative inquiry" that would establish the need for its manipulation of the racial makeup of the district.

   By contrast, where we have accepted a State's "good reasons" for using race in drawing district lines, the State made a strong showing of a pre-enactment analysis with justifiable conclusions. In Bethune-Hill, the State established that the primary mapdrawer "discussed the district with incumbents from other majority-minority districts[,] . . . considered turnout rates, the results of the recent contested primary and general elections," and the district's large prison population. 580 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 15). The State established that it had performed a "functional analysis," and acted to achieve an "informed bipartisan consensus." Id., at ___ (slip op., at 14). Texas's showing here is not equivalent.

   Perhaps Texas could have made a stronger showing, but it is the State's burden to prove narrow tailoring, and it did not do so on the record before us. We hold that HD90 is an impermissible racial gerrymander. On remand, the District Court will have to consider what if any remedy is appropriate at this time.

   *  *  *

   Except with respect to one Texas House district, we hold that the court below erred in effectively enjoining the use of the districting maps adopted by the Legislature in 2013. We therefore reverse with respect to No. 17-586; reverse in part and affirm in part with respect to No. 17-626; and remand for proceedings consistent with this opinion.

   It is so ordered.
