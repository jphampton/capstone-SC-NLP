U.S. Supreme Court

BROTHERHOOD OF R.R. SIGNALMEN v. SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA , 489 U.S. 1301 (1989)

   489 U.S. 1301

   BROTHERHOOD OF RAILROAD SIGNALMEN et al.
   v.
   SOUTHEASTERN PENNSYLVANIA TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY. No. A-715.

   Supreme Court of the United States

   March 14, 1989

   On application to vacate injunction.

   Justice BRENNAN, Circuit Justice.

   Applicants request me, as Circuit Justice, to enter an order " immediately dissolving" the injunction issued by the District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania. I deny the application. In my view, applicants have not "established that there is a 'reasonable probability' that four Justices will consider the issue sufficiently meritorious to grant certiorari." Rostker v. Goldberg, 448 U.S. 1306, 1308, 2 (1980) (Chambers Opinion).[ Brotherhood of R.R. Signalmen v. S.E. Penns .Transp. Authority 489 U.S. 1301 (1989) ]
