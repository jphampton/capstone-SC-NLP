   JUSTICE POWELL announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion in which THE CHIEF JUSTICE, JUSTICE WHITE, and JUSTICE O'CONNOR join.

   The question in this case is whether the Eleventh Amendment bars a state employee from suing the State in federal court under the Jones Act, ch. 250, 41 Stat. 1007, 46 U.S.C. § 688.


   The Texas Department of Highways and Public Transportation operates a free automobile and passenger ferry between


   Point Bolivar and Galveston, Texas. Petitioner Jean Welch, an employee of the State Highway Department, was injured while working on the ferry dock at Galveston. Relying on § 33 of the Jones Act, 46 U.S.C. § 688, she filed suit in the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Texas against the Highway Department and the State of Texas. [Footnote 1]

   The District Court dismissed the action as barred by the Eleventh Amendment. 533 F.Supp. 403, 407 (1982). A divided panel of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reversed, with each judge writing separately. 739 F.2d 1034 (1984). On rehearing en banc, the Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the District Court. 780 F.2d 1268 (1986). The court recognized that Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), held that an employee of a state-operated railroad company may bring an action in federal court under the Federal Employers' Liability Act (FELA), 53 Stat. 1404, 45 U.S.C. §§ 51-60. Parden is relevant to this case because the Jones Act applied the remedial provisions of the FELA to seamen. See 46 U.S.C. § 688(a). The court nevertheless concluded that

   "the broad sweep of the Parden decision, although it has not been overruled, has overtly been limited by later decisions as its full implications have surfaced."

   780 F.2d at 1270. The court relied on our holding that

   "Congress may abrogate the States' constitutionally secured immunity from suit in federal court only by making its intention unmistakably clear in the language of the statute."

   Atascadero State Hospital v.


   Scanlon, 473 U. S. 234, 473 U. S. 242 (1985). [Footnote 2] The Court of Appeals found no unmistakable expression of such an intention in the Jones Act. The court also held that Texas has not consented to suit under the Jones Act. 780 F.2d at 1273-1274 (citing Lyons v. Texas A & M University, 545 S.W.2d 56 (Tex.Civ.App.1976), writ refused, n.r.e.). We granted certiorari, 479 U.S. 811 (1986), and now affirm.


   The Eleventh Amendment provides:

   "The Judicial power of the United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."

   The Court has recognized that the significance of the Amendment "lies in its affirmation that the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity limits the grant of judicial authority in Art. III" of the Constitution. Pennhurst State School and Hospital v. Halderman, 465 U. S. 89, 465 U. S. 98 (1984) (Pennhurst II). Accordingly, as discussed more fully in 483 U. S. the Court long ago held that the Eleventh Amendment bars a citizen from bringing suit against the citizen's own State in federal court, even though the express terms of the Amendment refer only to suits by citizens of another State. Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1, 134 U. S. 10 (1890). See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651, 415 U. S. 662-663 (1974); Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279, 411 U. S. 280 (1973). For the same reason, the Court has


   held that the Amendment bars suits in admiralty against the States, even though such suits are not, strictly speaking, "suits in law or equity." Ex parte New York, No. 1, 256 U. S. 490, 256 U. S. 497 (1921) (Eleventh Amendment bars in personam actions against a State by its citizens); Ex parte New York, No. 2, 256 U. S. 503 (1921) (Eleventh Amendment bars actions in rem against vessel owned by the State and employed exclusively for governmental purposes). See Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U. S. 670, 458 U. S. 683, n. 17 (1982) (plurality opinion of STEVENS, J.); id. at 458 U. S. 706-710 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). See infra at 483 U. S. 488-490. [Footnote 3]

   The Court has recognized certain exceptions to the reach of the Eleventh Amendment. If a State waives its immunity and consents to suit in federal court, the suit is not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Clark v. Barnard, 108 U. S. 436, 108 U. S. 447 (1883). But, because "[c]onstructive consent is not a doctrine commonly associated with the surrender of constitutional rights," Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. at 415 U. S. 673, the Court will find a waiver by the State

   "only where stated 'by the most express language or by such overwhelming implications from the text as [will] leave no room for any other reasonable construction.'"

   Ibid. (quoting Murray v. Wilson Distilling Co., 213 U. S. 151, 213 U. S. 171 (1909)). Moreover, "[a] State's constitutional interest in immunity encompasses not merely whether it may be sued, but where it may be sued." Pennhurst II, 465 U.S. at 465 U. S. 99 (emphasis in original). Thus, a State does not waive Eleventh Amendment immunity in federal


   courts merely by waiving sovereign immunity in its own courts. Id. at 465 U. S. 99, n. 9.

   We also have recognized that the Eleventh Amendment "necessarily [is] limited by the enforcement provisions of § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment." Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U. S. 445, 427 U. S. 456 (1976). Consequently, Congress can abrogate the Eleventh Amendment without the States' consent when it acts pursuant to its power "to enforce, by appropriate legislation' the substantive provisions of the Fourteenth Amendment." Ibid. (quoting U.S.Const., Amdt. 14, § 5). As the Court of Appeals noted in this case, we have required that "Congress must express its intention to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment in unmistakable language in the statute itself." Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. at 473 U. S. 243. We have been unwilling to infer that Congress intended to negate the States' immunity from suit in federal court, given "the vital role of the doctrine of sovereign immunity in our federal system." Pennhurst II, supra, at 465 U. S. 99. Moreover, the courts properly are reluctant to
   infer that Congress has expanded our jurisdiction. See American Fire & Casualty Co. v. Finn, 341 U. S. 6, 341 U. S. 17 (1951) ("The jurisdiction of the federal courts is carefully guarded against expansion by judicial interpretation").


   We now apply these principles to the Jones Act. We note that the question whether the State of Texas has waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity is not before us. Both the District Court and the Court of Appeals held that the State has not consented to Jones Act suits in federal court. The petition for certiorari does not address this issue, and we do not regard it as fairly included in the questions on which certiorari was granted. [Footnote 4] Indeed, at oral argument counsel for


   petitioner conceded that the question of express waiver by the State "is not before the Court. . . ." Tr. of Oral Arg. 18. We therefore have no occasion to consider petitioner's argument in her brief on the merits that the Texas Tort Claims Act, Tex.Rev.Civ.Stat.Ann., Art. 6252-19 (Vernon, 1970, as amended 1973 Tex.Gen.Laws, ch. 50) constitutes an express waiver of the State's Eleventh Amendment immunity. Brief for Petitioner 29-34. We accept the holdings of the Court of Appeals and the District Court that it does not.

   Petitioner's remaining argument is that Congress has abrogated the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity from suit under the Jones Act. We assume, without deciding or intimating a view of the question, that the authority of Congress to subject unconsenting States to suit in federal court is not confined to § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment. See County of Oneida v. Oneida Indian Nation of New York, 470 U. S. 226, 470 U. S. 252 (1985). [Footnote 5] Petitioner's argument fails in any event, because Congress has not expressed in unmistakable statutory language its intention to allow States to be sued in federal court under the Jones Act. It is true that the Act extends to "[a]ny seaman who shall suffer personal injury in the course of his employment," § 33 (emphasis added). But the Eleventh Amendment marks a constitutional distinction between the States and other employers of


   seamen. Because of the role of the States in our federal system,

   "[a] general authorization for suit in federal court is not the kind of unequivocal statutory language sufficient to abrogate the Eleventh Amendment."

   Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, supra, at 473 U. S. 246. See Quern v. Jordan, 440 U. S. 332, 440 U. S. 342 (1979). See also Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. at 411 U. S. 285. In Scanlon, the Court held that § 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, which provides remedies for "any recipient of Federal assistance," does not contain the unmistakable language necessary to negate the States' Eleventh Amendment immunity. For the same reasons, we hold today that the general language of the Jones Act does not authorize suits against the States in federal court. [Footnote 6]

IV

   In Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., 377 U. S. 184 (1964), the Court considered whether an employee of a state-owned railroad could sue the State in federal court under the FELA. The Court concluded that the State of Alabama had waived its Eleventh Amendment immunity. Id. at 377 U. S. 186. It reasoned that Congress evidenced an intention to abrogate Eleventh Amendment immunity by making the FELA applicable to "every common carrier by railroad while engaging in commerce between any of the several States. . . ." § 1, 35 Stat. 65, 45 U.S.C. § 51. The Court mistakenly relied on cases holding that general language in the Safety Appliance Act, §§ 2, 6, and the Railway Labor Act, § 151 et seq., made those statutes applicable to the


   States. [Footnote 7] It reasoned that it

   "should not presume to say, in the absence of express provision to the contrary, that [Congress] intended to exclude a particular group of [railroad] workers from the benefits conferred by the Act."

   Parden v. Terminal Railway of Alabama Docks Dept., supra, at 377 U. S. 190. But, as discussed above, the constitutional role of the States sets them apart from other employers and defendants. Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. at 473 U. S. 246; Pennhurst II, 465 U.S. at 465 U. S. 99; Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. at 415 U. S. 673; Quern v. Jordan, supra, at 440 U. S. 342-343; Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, supra. As the dissenting opinion in Parden states:

   "It should not be easily inferred that Congress, in legislating pursuant to one article of the Constitution, intended to effect an automatic and compulsory waiver of rights arising under another. Only when Congress has clearly considered the problem and expressly declared that any State which undertakes given regulable conduct will be deemed thereby to have waived its immunity should courts disallow the invocation of this defense."

   377 U.S. at 377 U. S. 198-199 (WHITE, J., dissenting).


   Although our later decisions do not expressly overrule Parden, they leave no doubt that Parden's discussion of congressional intent to negate Eleventh Amendment immunity is no longer good law. In Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, the Court emphasized that "Parden was premised on the conclusion that [the State] . . . had consented to suit in the federal courts. . . ." 411 U.S. at 411 U. S. 281, n. 1. The Court refused to extend the reasoning of Parden to

   "infer that Congress in legislating pursuant to the Commerce Clause, which has grown to vast proportions in its applications, desired silently to deprive the States of an immunity they have long enjoyed under another part of the Constitution."

   Id. at 411 U. S. 285. In subsequent cases the Court consistently has required an unequivocal expression that Congress intended to override Eleventh Amendment immunity. Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, supra, at 483 U. S. 242; Pennhurst II, supra, at 465 U. S. 99; Quern v. Jordan, supra, at 440 U. S. 342-345. Accordingly, to the extent that Parden v. Terminal Railway, supra, is inconsistent with the requirement that an abrogation of Eleventh Amendment immunity by Congress must be expressed in unmistakably clear language, it is overruled. [Footnote 8]

V

   Today, for the fourth time in little more than two years, see Papasan v. Allain, 478 U. S. 265, 478 U. S. 293 (1986) (BRENNAN, J., concurring in part and dissenting in part); Green v. Mansour, 474 U. S. 64, 474 U. S. 74 (1985) (BRENNAN, J., dissenting); Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, supra, at 473 U. S. 247 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting), four Members of the Court urge that we overrule Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), and the long line of cases that has followed it. The rule of law depends in


   large part on adherence to the doctrine of stare decisis. Indeed, the doctrine is "a natural evolution from the very nature of our institutions." Lile, Some Views on the Rule of Stare Decisis, 4 Va.L.Rev. 95, 97 (1916). It follows that "any departure from the doctrine of stare decisis demands special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U. S. 203, 467 U. S. 212 (1984). Although the doctrine is not rigidly observed in constitutional cases,

   "[w]e should not be . . . unmindful, even when constitutional questions are involved, of the principle of stare decisis, by whose circumspect observance the wisdom of this Court as an institution transcending the moment can alone be brought to bear on the difficult problems that confront us."

   Green v. United States, 355 U. S. 184, 355 U. S. 215 (1957) (Frankfurter, J., dissenting). Despite these time-honored principles, the dissenters -- on the basis of ambiguous historical evidence -- would flatly overrule a number of major decisions of the Court, and cast doubt on others. See n 27, infra. Once again, the dissenters have placed in issue the fundamental nature of our federal system. [Footnote 9]

   A

   The constitutional foundation of state sovereign immunity has been well described by JUSTICE MARSHALL in his separate opinion in Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U. S. 279 (1973):

   "It had been widely understood prior to ratification of the Constitution that the provision in Art. III, § 2, concerning 'Controversies . . . between a State and Citizens of another State' would not provide a mechanism for making States unwilling defendants in federal court. The Court in Chisholm, however, considered the plain meaning of the constitutional provision to be controlling.


   The Eleventh Amendment served effectively to reverse the particular holding in Chisholm, and, more generally, to restore the original understanding, see, e.g., Hans v. Louisiana. . . . Thus, despite the narrowness of the language of the Amendment, its spirit has consistently guided this Court in interpreting the reach of the federal judicial power generally, and"

   "it has become established by repeated decisions of this court that the entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given: not one brought by citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of a foreign State, because of the Eleventh Amendment; and not even one brought by its own citizens, because of the fundamental rule of which the Amendment is but an exemplification."

   Id. at 411 U. S. 291-292 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in result) (citations omitted). Although the dissent rejects the Court's reading of the historical record, there is ample support for the Court's rationale, which has provided the basis for many important decisions.


   JUSTICE BRENNAN has argued at length that "[a] close examination of the historical records" demonstrates that "[t]here simply is no constitutional principle of state sovereign immunity." Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. at 473 U. S. 259 (dissenting opinion). In his dissent today, he repeats and expands this historical argument. Post at 483 U. S. 504-516. The dissent concedes, as it must, that three of the most prominent supporters of the Constitution -- Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall -- took the position that unconsenting States would not be subject to suit in federal court. [Footnote 10] The


   Court has relied on these statements in the past. See Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U.S. at 415 U. S. 660-662, n. 9; Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313, 292 U. S. 323-325 (1934); Hans v. Louisiana, 134


   U.S. at 134 U. S. 12-14. Although the dissenters would read these statements to apply only to cases in which no federal question is presented, see post at 483 U. S. 504-509; Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, supra, at 473 U. S. 268, 473 U. S. 276-278, the statements themselves do not suggest such a limitation. [Footnote 11] Moreover, the delicate problem of enforcing judgments against the States, that was raised by both Federalists and anti-Federalists, would have arisen in cases presenting a federal question as well as in other cases.

   It is true, as the Court observed in Hans, supra, at 134 U. S. 14, that opinions on this question differed during the ratification debates. Among those who disagreed with Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall were Edmund Randolph and James Wilson, both of whom supported ratification. [Footnote 12] Opponents of


   ratification, including Patrick Henry, George Mason, and Richard Henry Lee, feared that the Constitution would make unconsenting States subject to suit in federal court. Despite the strong rhetoric in the dissent, these statements fall far short of demonstrating a consensus that ratification of the Constitution would abrogate the sovereign immunity of the States. Indeed, the representations of Madison, Hamilton, and Marshall that the Constitution did not abrogate the States' sovereign immunity may have been essential to ratification. [Footnote 13] For example, the New York Convention appended to its ratification resolution a declaration of understanding that

   "the Judicial Power of the United States in cases in which a State may be a party does not extend to criminal Prosecutions, or to authorize any Suit by any Person against a State."

   2 Documentary History of the Constitution of the United States of America 194 (1894) [Footnote 14] At most,


   then, the historical materials show that -- to the extent this question was debated -- the intentions of the Framers and Ratifiers were ambiguous.


   No one doubts that the Eleventh Amendment nullified the Court's decision in Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 Dall. 419 (1793). Chisholm was an original action in assumpsit, filed by the South Carolina executor of a South Carolina estate, to recover money owed to the estate by Georgia. The Court held, over a dissent by Justice Iredell, that it had jurisdiction. The reaction to Chisholm was swift and hostile. The Eleventh Amendment passed both Houses of Congress by large majorities in 1794. Within two years of the Chisholm decision, the Eleventh Amendment was ratified by the necessary 12 States. [Footnote 15]

   The dissent, observing that jurisdiction in Chisholm itself was based solely on the fact that Chisholm was not a citizen of Georgia, argues that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to cases presenting a federal question. [Footnote 16] The text of the Amendment states that

   "[t]he Judicial power of the


   United States shall not be construed to extend to any suit in law or equity, commenced or prosecuted against one of the United States by Citizens of another State, or by Citizens or Subjects of any Foreign State."

   (Emphasis added.) Federal question actions unquestionably are suits "in law or equity"; thus, the plain language of the Amendment refutes this argument. [Footnote 17] Nor does the dissenting opinion offer any satisfactory explanation for the rejection, by an overwhelming margin, of an amendment offered by Senator Gallatin that would have allowed citizens to sue the States for causes of action arising under treaties. [Footnote 18]



   The Court's unanimous decision in Hans v. Louisiana, 134 U. S. 1 (1890), firmly established that the Eleventh Amendment embodies a broad constitutional principle of sovereign immunity. Hans, a citizen of Louisiana, brought an action against the State in federal court alleging that its failure to pay interest on certain bonds violated the Contract Clause. The Court considered substantially the same historical materials relied on by the dissent, and unanimously held that the action was barred by the doctrine of sovereign immunity. Justice Bradley's opinion for the Court observed:

   "Suppose that Congress, when proposing the Eleventh Amendment, had appended to it a proviso that nothing therein contained should prevent a State from being sued by its own citizens in cases arising under the Constitution or laws of the United States: can we imagine that it would have been adopted by the States? The supposition that it would is almost an absurdity on its face."

   Id. at 134 U. S. 15. In a short concurring opinion, Justice Harlan agreed with the other eight Members of the Court that

   "a suit directly against a State by one of its own citizens is not one to which the judicial power of the United States extends, unless the State itself consents to be sued."

   Id. at 134 U. S. 21.

   Contrary to the suggestion in the dissent, post at 483 U. S. 519, the fundamental principle enunciated in Hans has been among the most stable in our constitutional jurisprudence. Moreover, the dissent is simply wrong in asserting that the doctrine lacks a clear rationale, post at 483 U. S. 519. Because of the sensitive problems "inherent in making one sovereign appear against its will in the courts of the other," Employees v. Missouri Dept. of Public Health and Welfare, 411 U.S. at 411 U. S. 294 (MARSHALL, J., concurring in result), the doctrine of sovereign immunity


   plays a vital role in our federal system. The contours of state sovereign immunity are determined by the structure and requirements of the federal system. The rationale has been set out most completely in the Court's unanimous opinion, per Chief Justice Hughes, in Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U. S. 313 (1934). First, the United States may sue a State, because that is "inherent in the Constitutional plan." Id. at 292 U. S. 329. Absent such a provision, "the permanence of the Union might be endangered.'" Ibid. (quoting Oklahoma v. Texas, 258 U. S. 574, 258 U. S. 581 (1922)). Second, States may sue other States, because a federal forum for suits between States is "essential to the peace of the Union." Monaco v. Mississippi, supra, at 292 U. S. 328. Third, States may not be sued by foreign states, because

   "[c]ontroversies between a State and a foreign State may involve international questions in relation to which the United States has a sovereign prerogative."

   292 U.S. at 292 U. S. 331. Fourth, the Eleventh Amendment established "an absolute bar" to suits by citizens of other States or foreign states. Id. at 292 U. S. 329. Finally, "[p]rotected by the same fundamental principle [of sovereign immunity], the States, in the absence of consent, are immune from suits brought against them by their own citizens. . . ." Ibid. The Court has never questioned this basic framework set out in Monaco v. Mississippi.

   The dissenters offer their unsupported view that the principle of sovereign immunity is "pernicious'" because it assertedly protects States from the consequences of their illegal conduct and prevents Congress from "`tak[ing] steps it deems necessary and proper to achieve national goals within its constitutional authority.'" Post at 483 U. S. 521 (quoting Atascadero State Hospital v. Scanlon, 473 U.S. at 473 U. S. 302 (BRENNAN, J., dissenting)). Of course, the dissent's assertion that our cases construing the Eleventh Amendment deprive Congress of some of its constitutional power is simply question-begging. Moreover, as noted supra at 483 U. S. 475, Congress clearly has authority to limit the Eleventh Amendment when


   it acts to enforce the Fourteenth Amendment. Fitzpatrick v. Bitzer, 427 U.S. at 427 U. S. 456. The dissent's statement that sovereign immunity "protect[s] the States from the consequences of their illegal conduct" erroneously suggests that aggrieved individuals are left with no remedy for harmful state actions. Relief often may be obtained through suits against state officials, rather than the State itself, or through injunctive or other prospective remedies. Edelman v. Jordan, 415 U. S. 651 (1974). Municipalities and other local government agencies may be sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Monell v. New York City Dept. of Social Services, 436 U. S. 658 (1978). In addition, the States may provide relief by waiving their immunity from suit in state court on state law claims. [Footnote 19] That States are not liable in other circumstances is a necessary consequence of their role in a system of dual sovereignties. Although the dissent denies that sovereign immunity is "`required by the structure of
   the federal system,'" post at 483 U. S. 520 (quoting Atascadero, supra, at 473 U. S. 302), the principle has been deeply embedded in our federal system from its inception.

   B

   As a fallback position, the dissent argues that the doctrine of sovereign immunity has no application to suits in admiralty against unconsenting States. Post at 483 U. S. 497-504. This argument also is directly contrary to long-settled authority, as well as the Court's recognition that the Eleventh Amendment affirms "the fundamental principle of sovereign immunity," Pennhurst II, 465 U.S. at 465 U. S. 98; Monaco v. Mississippi, supra, at 292 U. S. 329.


   In Ex parte New York, No. 1, 256 U. S. 490 (1921), a unanimous Court held that unconsenting States are immune from


   in personam suits in admiralty brought by private citizens. [Footnote 20] Today the dissent asserts that the Court's opinion in Ex parte New York, No. 1 "did not attempt to justify its obliteration" of the traditional distinction between admiralty cases and cases in law or equity. Post at 483 U. S. 500. On the contrary, the Court expressly recognized the distinction, see 256 U.S. at 256 U. S. 497, and provided a reasoned basis for its holding:

   "That a State may not be sued without its consent is a fundamental rule of jurisprudence having so important a bearing upon the construction of the Constitution of the United States that it has become established by repeated decisions of this court that the entire judicial power granted by the Constitution does not embrace authority to entertain a suit brought by private parties against a State without consent given: not one brought by citizens of another State, or by citizens or subjects of a foreign State, because of the Eleventh Amendment; and not even one brought by its own citizens, because of the fundamental rule of which the Amendment is but an exemplification."

   Ibid. (citations omitted).

   The Court has adhered to this rule in subsequent cases. In re New York, No. 2, 256 U. S. 503 (1921), held that a private citizen may not bring an admiralty action in rem against a vessel owned by a State. The Court concluded that

   "'[t]o permit a creditor to seize and sell [a government-owned vessel] to collect his debt would be to permit him in some degree to destroy the government itself.'"

   Id. at 256 U. S. 511 (quoting Klein v. New Orleans, 99 U. S. 149, 99 U. S. 150 (1879)). [Footnote 21] More recently,


   in Florida Dept. of State v. Treasure Salvors, Inc., 458 U. S. 670 (1982), eight Members of the Court reaffirmed the settled rule that the Eleventh Amendment bars admiralty actions against the State or its officials seeking damages to be paid from the state treasury. Id. at 458 U. S. 698-699 (opinion of STEVENS, J.); id. at 458 U. S. 706-710 (WHITE, J., concurring in judgment in part and dissenting in part). To be sure, JUSTICE STEVENS' opinion states that

   "we need not decide the extent to which a federal district court exercising admiralty in rem jurisdiction over property before the court may adjudicate the rights of claimants to that property as against sovereigns that did not appear and voluntarily assert any claim that they had to the res."

   Id. at 458 U. S. 697. Of course, that statement has no application to an action in personam, such as Welch's suit under the Jones Act. [Footnote 22]


   The dissent suggests that In re New York, No. 1, decided in 1921, overruled settled law to the effect that the Constitution does not bar private citizens from bringing admiralty


   suits against the States. Post at 483 U. S. 500. The dissent concedes that the Court "did not pass on the applicability of the Eleventh Amendment in admiralty'" prior to 1921. Post at 483 U. S. 499 (citation omitted). It nevertheless asserts that dicta in United States v. Peters, 5 Cranch 115 (1809), and Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, 1 Pet. 110 (1828), support the "holding" of United States v. Bright, 24 Fed. Cas. 1232 (No. 14,647) (CC Pa. 1809), that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to suits in admiralty. In fact, these early cases cast considerable doubt on the dissent's position.

   United States v. Peters was a suit against the heirs of David Rittenhouse, who had served as treasurer of the State of Pennsylvania during the Revolutionary War. While Rittenhouse was treasurer, the State had seized a British vessel and sold it as a prize of war. Rittenhouse had deposited most of the proceeds in his own account, and had not turned them over to the State at the time of his death. Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court turned on the facts that "the suit was not instituted against the state, or its treasurer, but against the executrixes of David Rittenhouse," and that the State "had neither possession of, nor right to, the property." 5 Cranch at 9 U. S. 139-141. Indeed, language in the Court's opinion suggests that an action against the State would have been barred by the Eleventh Amendment:

   "The [eleventh] amendment simply provides that no suit shall be commenced or prosecuted against a state. The state cannot be made a defendant to a suit brought by an individual; but it remains the duty of the courts of the United States to decide all cases brought before them by citizens of one state against citizens of a different state where a state is not necessarily a defendant."

   Id. at 9 U. S. 139. Thus, Peters does not support the dissenters' position. [Footnote 23]


   The dissent's reliance on Governor of Georgia v. Madrazo, supra, also is misplaced. Madrazo, a Spanish subject, sued the Governor of Georgia in admiralty to obtain possession of a cargo of slaves or the proceeds from their sale. Chief Justice Marshall's opinion for the Court held that the Eleventh Amendment applies

   "where the chief magistrate of a state is sued, not by his name, but by his style of office, and the claim made upon him is entirely in his official character."

   Id. at 26 U. S. 123-124. Although Madrazo argued that the Eleventh Amendment does not apply to suits in admiralty, the Court carefully avoided the question. Instead, it held that the District Court where the action was filed had no jurisdiction regardless of whether the Eleventh Amendment applied. [Footnote 24]

   Madrazo then filed an original admiralty proceeding directly against Georgia in this Court. Once again, the Court avoided the question whether the Eleventh Amendment applies


   to suits in admiralty. Instead, the Court concluded that the case was not an admiralty action, but was "a mere personal suit against a state to recover proceeds in its possession." Ex parte Madrazzo, 7 Pet. 627, 32 U. S. 632 (1833). This rather strained conclusion was contrary to "the assumption of all concerned" that the action was maritime in nature. D. Currie, The Constitution and the Supreme Court, 1789-1888, p. 105, n. 98 (1985).

   On balance, the early cases in fact indicate that unconsenting States were immune from suits in admiralty. [Footnote 25] At the very least, they demonstrate that the dissent errs in suggesting that the amenability of States to suits in admiralty was "settled," post at 483 U. S. 499. [Footnote 26] We therefore decline to overrule precedents that squarely reject the dissenters' position.

   C

   In deciding yet another Eleventh Amendment case, we do not write on a clean slate. The general principle of state sovereign immunity has been adhered to without exception by


   this Court for almost a century. The dissent nevertheless urges the Court to ignore stare decisis and overrule the long and unbroken series of precedents reaffirming this principle. If the Court were to overrule these precedents, a number of other major decisions also would have to reconsidered. [Footnote 27] As we have stated, supra at 483 U. S. 478-479, the doctrine of stare decisis is of fundamental importance to the rule of law. For this


   reason, "any departure from the doctrine . . . demands special justification." Arizona v. Rumsey, 467 U.S. at 467 U. S. 212. The arguments made in the dissent fall far short of justifying such a drastic repudiation of this Court's prior decisions. [Footnote 28]

VI

   For the reasons we have stated, the judgment of the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit is affirmed.

   It is so ordered.
