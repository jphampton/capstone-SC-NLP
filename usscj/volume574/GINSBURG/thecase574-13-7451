   Justice Ginsburg announced the judgment of the Court and delivered an opinion, in which The Chief Justice, Justice Breyer, and Justice Sotomayor join.

   John Yates, a commercial fisherman, caught undersized red grouper in federal waters in the Gulf of Mexico. To prevent federal authorities from confirming that he had harvested undersized fish, Yates ordered a crew member to toss the suspect catch into the sea. For this offense, he was charged with, and convicted of, violating 18 U. S. C. 1519, which provides:

   Whoever knowingly alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the intent to impede, obstruct, or influence the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States or any case filed under title 11, or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter or case, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

   Yates was also indicted and convicted under 2232(a), which provides:

   Destruction or Removal of Property to Prevent Seizure. Whoever, before, during, or after any search for or seizure of property by any person authorized to make such search or seizure, knowingly destroys, damages, wastes, disposes of, transfers, or otherwise takes any action, or knowingly attempts to destroy, damage, waste, dispose of, transfer, or otherwise take any action, for the purpose of preventing or impairing the Government s lawful authority to take such property into its custody or control or to continue holding such property under its lawful custody and control, shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 5 years, or both.

   Yates does not contest his conviction for violating 2232(a), but he maintains that fish are not trapped within the term tangible object, as that term is used in 1519.

   Section 1519 was enacted as part of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 116Stat. 745, legislation designed to protect investors and restore trust in financial markets following the collapse of Enron Corporation. A fish is no doubt an object that is tangible; fish can be seen, caught, and handled, and a catch, as this case illustrates, is vulnerable to destruction. But it would cut 1519 loose from its financial-fraud mooring to hold that it encompasses any and all objects, whatever their size or significance, destroyed with obstructive intent. Mindful that in Sarbanes-Oxley, Congress trained its attention on corporate and accounting deception and cover-ups, we conclude that a matching construction of 1519 is in order: A tangible object captured by 1519, we hold, must be one used to record or preserve information.


   On August 23, 2007, the Miss Katie, a commercial fishing boat, was six days into an expedition in the Gulf of Mexico. Her crew numbered three, including Yates, the captain. Engaged in a routine offshore patrol to inspect both recreational and commercial vessels, Officer John Jones of the Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission decided to board the Miss Katie to check on the vessel s compliance with fishing rules. Although the Miss Katie was far enough from the Florida coast to be in exclusively federal waters, she was nevertheless within Officer Jones s jurisdiction. Because he had been deputized as a federal agent by the National Marine Fisheries Service, Officer Jones had authority to enforce federal, as well as state, fishing laws.

   Upon boarding the Miss Katie, Officer Jones noticed three red grouper that appeared to be undersized hanging from a hook on the deck. At the time, federal conservation regulations required immediate release of red grouper less than 20 inches long. 50 CFR 622.37(d)(2)(ii) (effective April 2, 2007). Violation of those regulations is a civil offense punishable by a fine or fishing license suspension. See 16 U. S. C. 1857(1)(A), (G), 1858(a), (g).

   Suspecting that other undersized fish might be on board, Officer Jones proceeded to inspect the ship s catch, setting aside and measuring only fish that appeared to him to be shorter than 20 inches. Officer Jones ultimately determined that 72 fish fell short of the 20inch mark. A fellow officer recorded the length of each of the undersized fish on a catch measurement verification form. With few exceptions, the measured fish were between 19 and 20 inches; three were less than 19 inches; none were less than 18.75 inches. After separating the fish measuring below 20 inches from the rest of the catch by placing them in wooden crates, Officer Jones directed Yates to leave the fish, thus segregated, in the crates until the Miss Katie returned to port. Before departing, Officer Jones issued Yates a citation for possession of undersized fish.

   Four days later, after the Miss Katie had docked in Cortez, Florida, Officer Jones measured the fish contained in the wooden crates. This time, however, the measured fish, although still less than 20 inches, slightly exceeded the lengths recorded on board. Jones surmised that the fish brought to port were not the same as those he had detected during his initial inspection. Under questioning, one of the crew members admitted that, at Yates s direction, he had thrown overboard the fish Officer Jones had measured at sea, and that he and Yates had replaced the tossed grouper with fish from the rest of the catch.

   For reasons not disclosed in the record before us, more than 32 months passed before criminal charges were lodged against Yates. On May 5, 2010, he was indicted for destroying property to prevent a federal seizure, in violation of 2232(a), and for destroying, concealing, and covering up undersized fish to impede a federal investigation, in violation of 1519.[1] By the time of the indictment, the minimum legal length for Gulf red grouper had been lowered from 20 inches to 18 inches. See 50 CFR 622.37(d)(2)(iv) (effective May 18, 2009). No measured fish in Yates s catch fell below that limit. The record does not reveal what civil penalty, if any, Yates received for his possession of fish undersized under the 2007 regulation. See 16 U. S. C. 1858(a).

   Yates was tried on the criminal charges in August 2011. At the end of the Government s case in chief, he moved for a judgment of acquittal on the 1519 charge. Pointing to 1519 s title and its origin as a provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, Yates argued that the section sets forth a documents offense and that its reference to tangible object[s] subsumes computer hard drives, logbooks, [and] things of that nature, not fish. App. 91 92. Yates acknowledged that the Criminal Code contains sections that would have been appropriate for the [G]overnment to pursue if it wished to prosecute him for tampering with evidence. App. 91. Section 2232(a), set out supra, at 1 2, fit that description. But 1519, Yates insisted, did not.

   The Government countered that a tangible object within 1519 s compass is simply something other than a document or record. App. 93. The trial judge expressed misgivings about reading tangible object as broadly as the Government urged: Isn t there a Latin phrase [about] construction of a statute . . . . The gist of it is . . . you take a look at [a] line of words, and you interpret the words consistently. So if you re talking about documents, and records, tangible objects are tangible objects in the nature of a document or a record, as opposed to a fish. Ibid. The first-instance judge nonetheless followed controlling Eleventh Circuit precedent. While recognizing that 1519 was passed as part of legislation targeting corporate fraud, the Court of Appeals had instructed that the broad language of 1519 is not limited to corporate fraud cases, and Congress is free to pass laws with language covering areas well beyond the particular crisis du jour that initially prompted legislative action. No.
   2:10 cr 66 FtM 29SPC (MD Fla., Aug. 8, 2011), App. 116 (quoting United States v. Hunt, 526 F. 3d 739, 744 (CA11 2008)). Accordingly, the trial court read tangible object as a term independent of record or document. App. 116. For violating 1519 and 2232(a), the court sentenced Yates to imprisonment for 30 days, followed by supervised release for three years. App. 118 120. For life, he will bear the stigma of having a federal felony conviction.

   On appeal, the Eleventh Circuit found the text of 1519 plain. 733 F. 3d 1059, 1064 (2013). Because tangible object was undefined in the statute, the Court of Appeals gave the term its ordinary or natural meaning, i.e., its dictionary definition, [h]aving or possessing physical form. Ibid. (quoting Black s Law Dictionary 1592 (9th ed. 2009)).

   We granted certiorari, 572 U. S. ___ (2014), and now reverse the Eleventh Circuit s judgment.


   The Sarbanes-Oxley Act, all agree, was prompted by the exposure of Enron s massive accounting fraud and revelations that the company s outside auditor, Arthur Andersen LLP, had systematically destroyed potentially incriminating documents. The Government acknowledges that 1519 was intended to prohibit, in particular, corporate document-shredding to hide evidence of financial wrong-doing. Brief for United States 46. Prior law made it an offense to intimidat[e], threate[n], or corruptly persuad[e] another person to shred documents. 1512(b) (emphasis added). Section 1519 cured a conspicuous omission by imposing liability on a person who destroys records himself. See S. Rep. No. 107 146, p. 14 (2002) (describing 1519 as a new general anti shredding provision and explaining that certain current provisions make it a crime to persuade another person to destroy documents, but not a crime to actually destroy the same documents yourself ). The new section also expanded prior law by including within
   the provision s reach any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States. Id., at 14 15.

   In the Government s view, 1519 extends beyond the principal evil motivating its passage. The words of 1519, the Government argues, support reading the provision as a general ban on the spoliation of evidence, covering all physical items that might be relevant to any matter under federal investigation.

   Yates urges a contextual reading of 1519, tying tangible object to the surrounding words, the placement of the provision within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, and related provisions enacted at the same time, in particular 1520 and 1512(c)(1), see infra, at 10, 12 13. Section 1519, he maintains, targets not all manner of evidence, but records, documents, and tangible objects used to preserve them, e.g., computers, servers, and other media on which information is stored.

   We agree with Yates and reject the Government s unrestrained reading. Tangible object in 1519, we conclude, is better read to cover only objects one can use to record or preserve information, not all objects in the physical world.

   A

   The ordinary meaning of an object that is tangible, as stated in dictionary definitions, is a discrete . . . thing, Webster s Third New International Dictionary 1555 (2002), that possess[es] physical form, Black s Law Dictionary 1683 (10th ed. 2014). From this premise, the Government concludes that tangible object, as that term appears in 1519, covers the waterfront, including fish from the sea.

   Whether a statutory term is unambiguous, however, does not turn solely on dictionary definitions of its component words. Rather, [t]he plainness or ambiguity of statutory language is determined [not only] by reference to the language itself, [but as well by] the specific context in which that language is used, and the broader context of the statute as a whole. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U. S. 337, 341 (1997) . See also Deal v. United States, 508 U. S. 129, 132 (1993) (it is a fundamental principle of statutory construction (and, indeed, of language itself) that the meaning of a word cannot be determined in isolation, but must be drawn from the context in which it is used ). Ordinarily, a word s usage accords with its dictionary definition. In law as in life, however, the same words, placed in different contexts, sometimes mean different things.

   We have several times affirmed that identical language may convey varying content when used in different statutes, sometimes even in different provisions of the same statute. See, e.g., FAA v. Cooper, 566 U. S. ___, ___ ___ (2012), (slip op., at 6 7) ( actual damages has different meanings in different statutes); Wachovia Bank, N. A. v. Schmidt, 546 U. S. 303 314 (2006) ( located has different meanings in different provisions of the National Bank Act); General Dynamics Land Systems, Inc. v. Cline, 540 U. S. 581 597 (2004) ( age has different meanings in different provisions of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967); United States v. Cleveland Indians Baseball Co., 532 U. S. 200, 213 (2001) ( wages paid has different meanings in different provisions of Title 26 U. S. C.); Robinson, 519 U. S., at 342 344 ( employee has different meanings in different sections of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964); Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals Inc. v. Thompson, 478 U. S. 804 808 (1986) (
   arising under has different meanings in U. S. Const., Art. III, 2, and 28 U. S. C. 1331); District of Columbia v. Carter, 409 U. S. 418 421 (1973) ( State or Territory has different meanings in 42 U. S. C. 1982 and 1983); Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, Inc. v. United States, 286 U. S. 427 437 (1932) ( trade or commerce has different meanings in different sections of the Sherman Act). As the Court observed in Atlantic Cleaners & Dyers, 286 U. S., at 433:

   Most words have different shades of meaning and consequently may be variously construed . . . . Where the subject matter to which the words refer is not the same in the several places where [the words] are used, or the conditions are different, or the scope of the legislative power exercised in one case is broader than that exercised in another, the meaning well may vary to meet the purposes of the law, to be arrived at by a consideration of the language in which those purposes are expressed, and of the circumstances under which the language was employed. [2]

   In short, although dictionary definitions of the words tangible and object bear consideration, they are not dispositive of the meaning of tangible object in 1519.

   Supporting a reading of tangible object, as used in 1519, in accord with dictionary definitions, the Government points to the appearance of that term in Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16. That Rule requires the prosecution to grant a defendant s request to inspect tangible objects within the Government s control that have utility for the defense. See Fed. Rule Crim. Proc. 16(a)(1)(E).

   Rule 16 s reference to tangible objects has been interpreted to include any physical evidence. See 5 W. LaFave, J. Israel, N. King, & O. Kerr, Criminal Procedure 20.3(g), pp. 405 406, and n. 120 (3d ed. 2007). Rule 16 is a discovery rule designed to protect defendants by compelling the prosecution to turn over to the defense evidence material to the charges at issue. In that context, a comprehensive construction of tangible objects is fitting. In contrast, 1519 is a penal provision that refers to tangible object not in relation to a request for information relevant to a specific court proceeding, but rather in relation to federal investigations or proceedings of every kind, including those not yet begun.[3] See Commissioner v. National Carbide Corp., 167 F. 2d 304, 306 (CA2 1948) (Hand, J.) ( words are chameleons, which reflect the color of their environment ). Just as the context of Rule 16 supports giving tangible object a meaning as broad as its dictionary definition, the context of 1519
   tugs strongly in favor of a narrower reading.

   B

   Familiar interpretive guides aid our construction of the words tangible object as they appear in 1519.

   We note first 1519 s caption: Destruction, alteration, or falsification of records in Federal investigations and bankruptcy. That heading conveys no suggestion that the section prohibits spoliation of any and all physical evidence, however remote from records. Neither does the title of the section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act in which 1519 was placed, 802: Criminal penalties for altering documents. 116Stat. 800. Furthermore, 1520, the only other provision passed as part of 802, is titled Destruction of corporate audit records and addresses only that specific subset of records and documents. While these headings are not commanding, they supply cues that Congress did not intend tangible object in 1519 to sweep within its reach physical objects of every kind, including things no one would describe as records, documents, or devices closely associated with them. See Almendarez-Torres v. United States, 523 U. S. 224, 234 (1998) ( [T]he title of a statute and the heading of a section are tools
   available for the resolution of a doubt about the meaning of a statute. (internal quotation marks omitted)). If Congress indeed meant to make 1519 an all-encompassing ban on the spoliation of evidence, as the dissent believes Congress did, one would have expected a clearer indication of that intent.

   Section 1519 s position within Chapter 73 of Title 18 further signals that 1519 was not intended to serve as a cross-the-board ban on the destruction of physical evidence of every kind. Congress placed 1519 (and its companion provision 1520) at the end of the chapter, following immediately after the pre-existing 1516, 1517, and 1518, each of them prohibiting obstructive acts in specific contexts. See 1516 (audits of recipients of federal funds); 1517 (federal examinations of financial institutions); 1518 (criminal investigations of federal health care offenses). See also S. Rep. No. 107 146, at 7 (observing that 1517 and 1518 apply to obstruction in certain limited types of cases, such as bankruptcy fraud, examinations of financial institutions, and healthcare fraud ).

   But Congress did not direct codification of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act s other additions to Chapter 73 adjacent to these specialized provisions. Instead, Congress directed placement of those additions within or alongside retained provisions that address obstructive acts relating broadly to official proceedings and criminal trials: Section 806, Civil Action to protect against retaliation in fraud cases, was codified as 1514A and inserted between the pre-existing 1514, which addresses civil actions to restrain harassment of victims and witnesses in criminal cases, and 1515, which defines terms used in 1512 and 1513. Section 1102, Tampering with a record or otherwise impeding an official proceeding, was codified as 1512(c) and inserted within the pre-existing 1512, which addresses tampering with a victim, witness, or informant to impede any official proceeding. Section 1107, Retaliation against informants, was codified as 1513(e) and inserted within the pre-existing 1513, which addresses
   retaliation against a victim, witness, or informant in any official proceeding. Congress thus ranked 1519, not among the broad proscriptions, but together with specialized provisions expressly aimed at corporate fraud and financial audits. This placement accords with the view that Congress conception of 1519 s coverage was considerably more limited than the Government s.[4]

   The contemporaneous passage of 1512(c)(1), which was contained in a section of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act discrete from the section embracing 1519 and 1520, is also instructive. Section 1512(c)(1) provides:

   (c) Whoever corruptly

   (1) alters, destroys, mutilates, or conceals a record, document, or other object, or attempts to do so, with the intent to impair the object s integrity or availability for use in an official proceeding

   . . . . .

   shall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than 20 years, or both.

   The legislative history reveals that 1512(c)(1) was drafted and proposed after 1519. See 148 Cong. Rec. 12518, 13088 13089 (2002). The Government argues, and Yates does not dispute, that 1512(c)(1) s reference to other object includes any and every physical object. But if 1519 s reference to tangible object already included all physical objects, as the Government and the dissent contend, then Congress had no reason to enact 1512(c)(1): Virtually any act that would violate 1512(c)(1) no doubt would violate 1519 as well, for 1519 applies to the investigation or proper administration of any matter within the jurisdiction of any department or agency of the United States . . . or in relation to or contemplation of any such matter, not just to an official proceeding. [5]

   The Government acknowledges that, under its reading, 1519 and 1512(c)(1) significantly overlap. Brief for United States 49. Nowhere does the Government explain what independent function 1512(c)(1) would serve if the Government is right about the sweeping scope of 1519. We resist a reading of 1519 that would render superfluous an entire provision passed in proximity as part of the same Act.[6] See Marx v. General Revenue Corp., 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 14) ( [T]he canon against surplusage is strongest when an interpretation would render superfluous another part of the same statutory scheme. ).

   The words immediately surrounding tangible object in 1519 falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record [or] document also cabin the contextual meaning of that term. As explained in Gustafson v. Alloyd Co., 513 U. S. 561, 575 (1995) , we rely on the principle of noscitur a sociis a word is known by the company it keeps to avoid ascribing to one word a meaning so broad that it is inconsistent with its accompanying words, thus giving unintended breadth to the Acts of Congress. (internal quotation marks omitted). See also United States v. Williams, 553 U. S. 285, 294 (2008) ( a word is given more precise content by the neighboring words with which it is associated ). In Gustafson, we interpreted the word communication in 2(10) of the Securities Act of 1933 to refer to a public communication, rather than any communication, because the word appeared in a list with other words, notably notice, circular, [and] advertisement, making it apparent that the list refer[red] to documents of wide
   dissemination. 513 U. S., at 575 576. And we did so even though the list began with the word any.

   The noscitur a sociis canon operates in a similar manner here. Tangible object is the last in a list of terms that begins any record [or] document. The term is therefore appropriately read to refer, not to any tangible object, but specifically to the subset of tangible objects involving records and documents, i.e., objects used to record or preserve information. See United States Sentencing Commission, Guidelines Manual 2J1.2, comment., n. 1 (Nov. 2014) ( Records, documents, or tangible objects includes (A) records, documents, or tangible objects that are stored on, or that are, magnetic, optical, digital, other electronic, or other storage mediums or devices; and (B) wire or electronic communications. ).

   This moderate interpretation of tangible object accords with the list of actions 1519 proscribes. The section applies to anyone who alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, covers up, falsifies, or makes a false entry in any record, document, or tangible object with the requisite obstructive intent. (Emphasis added.) The last two verbs, falsif[y] and mak[e] a false entry in, typically take as grammatical objects records, documents, or things used to record or preserve information, such as logbooks or hard drives. See, e.g., Black s Law Dictionary 720 (10th ed. 2014) (defining falsify as [t]o make deceptive; to counterfeit, forge, or misrepresent; esp., to tamper with (a document, record, etc.) ). It would be unnatural, for example, to describe a killer s act of wiping his fingerprints from a gun as falsifying the murder weapon. But it would not be strange to refer to falsifying data stored on a hard drive as simply falsifying a hard drive. Furthermore, Congress did not include on 1512(c)(1) s
   list of prohibited actions falsifies or makes a false entry in. See 1512(c)(1) (making it unlawful to alte[r], destro[y], mutilat[e], or concea[l] a record, document, or other object with the requisite obstructive intent). That contemporaneous omission also suggests that Congress intended tangible object in 1519 to have a narrower scope than other object in 1512(c)(1).[7]

   A canon related to noscitur a sociis, ejusdem generis, counsels: Where general words follow specific words in a statutory enumeration, the general words are [usually] construed to embrace only objects similar in nature to those objects enumerated by the preceding specific words. Washington State Dept. of Social and Health Servs. v. Guardianship Estate of Keffeler, 537 U. S. 371, 384 (2003) (internal quotation marks omitted). In Begay v. United States, 553 U. S. 137 143 (2008), for example, we relied on this principle to determine what crimes were covered by the statutory phrase any crime . . . that . . . is burglary, arson, or extortion, involves use of explosives, or otherwise involves conduct that presents a serious potential risk of physical injury to another, 18 U. S. C. 924(e)(2)(B)(ii). The enumeration of specific crimes, we explained, indicates that the otherwise involves provision covers only similar crimes, rather than every crime that presents a serious potential risk of physical
   injury to another. 553 U. S., at 142. Had Congress intended the latter all encompassing meaning, we observed, it is hard to see why it would have needed to include the examples at all. Ibid. See also CSX Transp., Inc. v. Alabama Dept. of Revenue, 562 U. S. 277 , ___ (2011) (slip op., at 16) ( We typically use ejusdem generis to ensure that a general word will not render specific words meaningless. ). Just so here. Had Congress intended tangible object in 1519 to be interpreted so generically as to capture physical objects as dissimilar as documents and fish, Congress would have had no reason to refer specifically to record or document. The Government s unbounded reading of tangible object would render those words misleading surplusage.

   Having used traditional tools of statutory interpretation to examine markers of congressional intent within the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and 1519 itself, we are persuaded that an aggressive interpretation of tangible object must be rejected. It is highly improbable that Congress would have buried a general spoliation statute covering objects of any and every kind in a provision targeting fraud in financial record-keeping.

   The Government argues, however, that our inquiry would be incomplete if we failed to consider the origins of the phrase record, document, or tangible object. Congress drew that phrase, the Government says, from a 1962 Model Penal Code (MPC) provision, and reform proposals based on that provision. The MPC provision and proposals prompted by it would have imposed liability on anyone who alters, destroys, mutilates, conceals, or removes a record, document or thing. See ALI, MPC 241.7(1), p. 175 (1962). Those proscriptions were understood to refer to all physical evidence. See MPC 241.7, Comment 3, at 179 (1980) (provision applies to any physical object ). Accordingly, the Government reasons, and the dissent exuberantly agrees, post, at 4 5, Congress must have intended 1519 to apply to the universe of physical evidence.

   The inference is unwarranted. True, the 1962 MPC provision prohibited tampering with any kind of physical evidence. But unlike 1519, the MPC provision did not prohibit actions that specifically relate to records, documents, and objects used to record or preserve information. The MPC provision also ranked the offense as a misdemeanor and limited liability to instances in which the actor believ[es] that an official proceeding or investigation is pending or about to be instituted. MPC 241.7(1), at 175. Yates would have had scant reason to anticipate a felony prosecution, and certainly not one instituted at a time when even the smallest of the fish he caught came within the legal limit. See supra, at 4; cf. Bond v. United States, 572 U. S. ___, ___ (2014), (slip op., at 14) (rejecting boundless reading of a statutory term given deeply serious consequences that reading would entail). A proposed federal offense in line with the MPC provision, advanced by a federal commission in 1971, was
   similarly qualified. See Final Report of the National Commission on Reform of Federal Criminal Laws 1323, pp. 116 117 (1971).

   Section 1519 conspicuously lacks the limits built into the MPC provision and the federal proposal. It describes not a misdemeanor, but a felony punishable by up to 20 years in prison. And the section covers conduct intended to impede any federal investigation or proceeding, including one not even on the verge of commencement. Given these significant differences, the meaning of record, document, or thing in the MPC provision and a kindred proposal is not a reliable indicator of the meaning Congress assigned to record, document, or tangible object in 1519. The MPC provision, in short, tells us neither what Congress wrote [nor] what Congress wanted, cf. post, at 15, concerning Yates s small fish as the subject of a federal felony prosecution.

   C

   Finally, if our recourse to traditional tools of statutory construction leaves any doubt about the meaning of tangible object, as that term is used in 1519, we would invoke the rule that ambiguity concerning the ambit of criminal statutes should be resolved in favor of lenity. Cleveland v. United States, 531 U. S. 12, 25 (2000) (quoting Rewis v. United States, 401 U. S. 808, 812 (1971) ). That interpretative principle is relevant here, where the Government urges a reading of 1519 that exposes individuals to 20-year prison sentences for tampering with any physical object that might have evidentiary value in any federal investigation into any offense, no matter whether the investigation is pending or merely contemplated, or whether the offense subject to investigation is criminal or civil. See Liparota v. United States, 471 U. S. 419, 427 (1985) ( Application of the rule of lenity ensures that criminal statutes will provide fair warning concerning conduct rendered illegal and strikes the
   appropriate balance between the legislature, the prosecutor, and the court in defining criminal liability. ). In determining the meaning of tangible object in 1519, it is appropriate, before we choose the harsher alternative, to require that Congress should have spoken in language that is clear and definite. See Cleveland, 531 U. S., at 25 (quoting United States v. Universal C. I. T. Credit Corp., 344 U. S. 218, 222 (1952) ). See also Jones v. United States, 529 U. S. 848 859 (2000) (rule of lenity reinforces the conclusion that arson of an owner-occupied residence is not subject to federal prosecution under 18 U. S. C. 844(i) because such a residence does not qualify as property used in commerce or commerce-affecting activity).[8]

   * * *

   For the reasons stated, we resist reading 1519 expansively to create a coverall spoliation of evidence statute, advisable as such a measure might be. Leaving that important decision to Congress, we hold that a tangible object within 1519 s compass is one used to record or preserve information. The judgment of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit is therefore reversed, and the case is remanded for further proceedings.

   It is so ordered.
