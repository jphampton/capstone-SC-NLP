   Justice Kagan delivered the opinion of the Court.

   The Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA or Act) provides that a tort claim against the United States "shall be for-ever barred" unless it is presented to the "appropriate Fed-eral agency within two years after such claim accrues" and then brought to federal court "within six months" after the agency acts on the claim. 28 U. S. C. §2401(b). In each of the two cases we resolve here, the claimant missed one of those deadlines, but requested equitable tolling on the ground that she had a good reason for filing late. The Government responded that §2401(b)'s time limits are not subject to tolling because they are jurisdictional restrictions. Today, we reject the Government's argument and conclude that courts may toll both of the FTCA's limitations periods.


   In the first case, respondent Kwai Fun Wong asserts that the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS) falsely imprisoned her for five days in 1999. As the FTCA requires, Wong first presented that claim to the INS within two years of the alleged unlawful action. See §2401(b); §2675(a). The INS denied the administrative complaint on December 3, 2001. Under the Act, that gave Wong six months, until June 3, 2002, to bring her tort claim in federal court. See §2401(b).

   Several months prior to the INS's decision, Wong had filed suit in federal district court asserting various non-FTCA claims against the Government arising out of the same alleged misconduct. Anticipating the INS's ruling, Wong moved in mid-November 2001 to amend the complaint in that suit by adding her tort claim. On April 5, 2002, a Magistrate Judge recommended granting Wong leave to amend. But the District Court did not finally adopt that proposal until June 25--three weeks after the FTCA's 6-month deadline.

   The Government moved to dismiss the tort claim on the ground that it was filed late. The District Court at first rejected the motion. It recognized that Wong had managed to add her FTCA claim only after §2401(b)'s 6-month time period had expired. But the court equitably tolled that period for all the time between the Magistrate Judge's recommendation and its own order allowing amendment, thus bringing Wong's FTCA claim within the statutory deadline. Several years later, the Government moved for reconsideration of that ruling based on an intervening Ninth Circuit decision. This time, the District Court dismissed Wong's claim, reasoning that §2401(b)'s 6-month time bar was jurisdictional and therefore not subject to equitable tolling. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit agreed to hear the case en banc to address an intra-circuit conflict on the issue. The en banc court held that the 6-month limit is not jurisdictional and that equitable tolling is available. Kwai Fun Wong v. Beebe, 732 F. 3d 1030
   (2013). It then confirmed the District Court's prior ruling that the circumstances here justify tolling because Wong "exercis[ed] due diligence" in attempting to amend her complaint before the statutory deadline. Id., at 1052.

   The second case before us arises from a deadly highway accident. Andrew Booth was killed in 2005 when a car in which he was riding crossed through a cable median barrier and crashed into oncoming traffic. The following year, respondent Marlene June, acting on behalf of Booth's young son, filed a wrongful death action alleging that the State of Arizona and its contractor had negligently constructed and maintained the median barrier. Years into that state-court litigation, June contends, she discovered that the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) had approved installation of the barrier knowing it had not been properly crash tested.

   Relying on that new information, June presented a tort claim to the FHWA in 2010, more than five years after the accident. The FHWA denied the claim, and June promptly filed this action in federal district court. The court dismissed the suit because June had failed to submit her claim to the FHWA within two years of the collision. The FTCA's 2-year bar, the court ruled, is jurisdictional and therefore not subject to equitable tolling; accordingly, the court did not consider June's contention that tolling was proper because the Government had concealed its failure to require crash testing. On appeal, the Ninth Circuit reversed in light of its recent decision in Wong, thus holding that §2401(b)'s 2-year deadline, like its 6-month counterpart, is not jurisdictional and may be tolled. 550 Fed. Appx. 505 (2013).

   We granted certiorari in both cases, 573 U. S. ___ (2014), to resolve a circuit split about whether courts may equitably toll §2401(b)'s two time limits. Compare, e.g., In re FEMA Trailer Formaldehyde Prods. Liability Litigation, 646 F. 3d 185, 190-191 (CA5 2011) (per curiam) (tolling not available), with Arteaga v. United States, 711 F. 3d 828, 832-833 (CA7 2013) (tolling allowed).[1] We now affirm the Court of Appeals' rulings.


   Irwin v. Department of Veterans Affairs, 498 U. S. 89, 95 (1990) , sets out the framework for deciding "the applicability of equitable tolling in suits against the Government." In Irwin, we recognized that time bars in suits between private parties are presumptively subject to equitable tolling. See id., at 95-96. That means a court usually may pause the running of a limitations statute in private litigation when a party "has pursued his rights diligently but some extraordinary circumstance" prevents him from meeting a deadline. Lozano v. Montoya Alvarez, 572 U. S. 1 , ___ (2014) (slip op., at 7). We held in Irwin that "the same rebuttable presumption of equitable tolling" should also apply to suits brought against the United States under a statute waiving sovereign immunity. 498 U. S., at 95-96. Our old "ad hoc," law-by-law approach to determining the availability of tolling in those suits, we reasoned, had produced inconsistency and "unpredictability" without the offsetting virtue of
   enhanced "fidelity to the intent of Congress." Id., at 95. Adopting the "general rule" used in private litigation, we stated, would "amount[ ] to little, if any, broadening" of a statutory waiver of immunity. Ibid. Accordingly, we thought such a presumption "likely to be a realistic assessment of legislative intent as well as a practically useful" rule of interpretation. Ibid.

   A rebuttable presumption, of course, may be rebutted, so Irwin does not end the matter. When enacting a time bar for a suit against the Government (as for one against a private party), Congress may reverse the usual rule if it chooses. See id., at 96. The Government may therefore attempt to establish, through evidence relating to a particular statute of limitations, that Congress opted to forbid equitable tolling.

   One way to meet that burden--and the way the Government pursues here--is to show that Congress made the time bar at issue jurisdictional.[2] When that is so, a litigant's failure to comply with the bar deprives a court of all authority to hear a case. Hence, a court must enforce the limitation even if the other party has waived any timeliness objection. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U. S. ___, ___-___ (2012) (slip op., at 5-6). And, more crucially here, a court must do so even if equitable considerations would support extending the prescribed time period. See John R. Sand & Gravel Co. v. United States, 552 U. S. 130 -134 (2008).[3]

   Given those harsh consequences, the Government must clear a high bar to establish that a statute of limitations is jurisdictional. In recent years, we have repeatedly held that procedural rules, including time bars, cabin a court's power only if Congress has "clearly state[d]" as much. Sebelius v. Auburn Regional Medical Center, 568 U. S. ___, ___ (2013) (slip op., at 6) (quoting Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U. S. 500, 515 (2006) ); see Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 6-7). "[A]bsent such a clear statement, . . . `courts should treat the restriction as nonjurisdictional.' " Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 6-7) (quoting Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 516). That does not mean "Congress must incant magic words." Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 7). But traditional tools of statutory construction must plainly show that Congress imbued a procedural bar with jurisdictional consequences.

   And in applying that clear statement rule, we have made plain that most time bars are nonjurisdictional. See, e.g., id., at ___ (slip op., at 8) (noting the rarity of jurisdictional time limits). Time and again, we have described filing deadlines as "quintessential claim-processing rules," which "seek to promote the orderly progress of litigation," but do not deprive a court of authority to hear a case. Henderson v. Shinseki, 562 U. S. 428, 435 (2011) ; see Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___ (slip op., at 8); Scarborough v. Principi, 541 U. S. 401, 413 (2004) . That is so, contrary to the dissent's suggestion, see post, at 4, 10-11, even when the time limit is important (most are) and even when it is framed in mandatory terms (again, most are); indeed, that is so "however emphatic[ally]" expressed those terms may be, Henderson, 562 U. S., at 439 (quoting Union Pacific R. Co. v. Locomotive Engineers, 558 U. S. 67, 81 (2009) ). Congress must do something special, beyond setting an
   exception-free deadline, to tag a statute of limitations as jurisdictional and so prohibit a court from tolling it.

   In enacting the FTCA, Congress did nothing of that kind. It provided no clear statement indicating that §2401(b) is the rare statute of limitations that can deprive a court of jurisdiction. Neither the text nor the context nor the legislative history indicates (much less does so plainly) that Congress meant to enact something other than a standard time bar.

   Most important, §2401(b)'s text speaks only to a claim's timeliness, not to a court's power. It states that "[a] tort claim against the United States shall be forever barred unless it is presented [to the agency] within two years . . . or unless action is begun within six months" of the agency's denial of the claim. That is mundane statute-of-limitations language, saying only what every time bar,by definition, must: that after a certain time a claimis barred. See infra, at 11, n. 7 (citing many similarly worded limitations statutes). The language is mandatory--"shall" be barred--but (as just noted) that is true of most such statutes, and we have consistently found it of no consequence. See, e.g., Gonzalez, 565 U. S., at ___-___ (slip op., at 10-11). Too, the language might be viewed as emphatic--"forever" barred--but (again) we have often held that not to matter. See, e.g., Henderson, 562 U. S., at 439; Union Pacific, 558 U. S., at 81. What matters instead is that §2401(b) "does not speak
   in jurisdictional terms or refer in any way to the jurisdiction of the district courts." Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515 (quoting Zipes v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 455 U. S. 385, 394 (1982) ). It does not define a federal court's jurisdiction over tort claims generally, address its authority to hear untimely suits, or in any way cabin its usual equitable powers. Section 2401(b), in short, "reads like an ordinary, run-of-the-mill statute of limitations," spelling out a litigant's filing obligations without restricting a court's authority. Holland v. Flor-ida, 560 U. S. 631, 647 (2010) .[4]

   Statutory context confirms that reading. This Court has often explained that Congress's separation of a filing deadline from a jurisdictional grant indicates that the time bar is not jurisdictional. See Henderson, 562 U. S., at 439-440; Reed Elsevier, Inc. v. Muchnick, 559 U. S. 154 -165 (2010); Arbaugh, 546 U. S., at 515; Zipes, 455 U. S., at 393-394. So too here. Whereas §2401(b) houses the FTCA's time limitations, a different section of Title 28 confers power on federal district courts to hear FTCA claims. See §1346(b)(1) ("district courts . . . shall have exclusive jurisdiction" over tort claims against the United States). Nothing conditions the jurisdictional grant on the limitations periods, or otherwise links those separate provisions. Treating §2401(b)'s time bars as jurisdictional would thus disregard the structural divide built into the statute.

   Finally, even assuming legislative history alone could provide a clear statement (which we doubt), none does so here. The report accompanying the FTCA did not discuss whether §2401(b)'s time limits are jurisdictional. See S. Rep. No. 1400, 79th Cong., 2d Sess., 33 (1946). And in amending §2401(b) four times after its enactment, Congress declined again (four times over) to say anything specific about whether the statute of limitations imposes a jurisdictional bar. Congress thus failed to provide anything like the clear statement this Court has demanded before deeming a statute of limitations to curtail a court's power.

   And so we wind up back where we started, with Irwin's "general rule" that equitable tolling is available in suits against the Government. 498 U. S., at 95. The justification the Government offers for departing from that principle fails: Section 2401(b) is not a jurisdictional requirement. The time limits in the FTCA are just time limits, nothing more. Even though they govern litigation against the Government, a court can toll them on equitable grounds.


   The Government balks at that straightforward analysis, claiming that it overlooks two reasons for thinking §2401(b) jurisdictional. But neither of those reasons is persuasive. Indeed, our precedents in this area foreclose them both.

   A

   The Government principally contends that §2401(b) is jurisdictional because it includes the same language as the statute of limitations governing contract (and some other non-tort) suits brought against the United States under the Tucker Act. See §2501.[5] That statute long provided that such suits "shall be forever barred" if not filed within six years. Act of Mar. 3, 1863, §10, 12Stat. 767; see Act of Mar. 3, 1911, §156, 36Stat. 1139.[6] And this Court repeatedly held that 6-year limit to be jurisdictional and thus not subject to equitable tolling. See Kendall v. United States, 107 U. S. 123 -126 (1883); Finn v. United States, 123 U. S. 227, 232 (1887) ; Soriano v. United States, 352 U. S. 270 -274 (1957). When Congress drafted the FTCA's time bar, it used the same "shall be forever barred" language (though selecting a shorter limitations period). "In these circumstances," the Government maintains, "the only reasonable conclusion is that Congress intended the FTCA's identically worded
   time limit to be a jurisdictional bar." Brief for United States in Wong 21-22. According to the Government, Congress wanted the FTCA to serve as "a tort-law analogue to the Tucker Act" and incorporated the words "shall be forever barred" to similarly preclude equitable tolling. Reply Brief in Wong 4. (The dissent relies heavily on the same argument. See post, at 4-8.)

   But the Government takes too much from Congress's use in §2401(b) of an utterly unremarkable phrase. The "shall be forever barred" formulation was a commonplace in federal limitations statutes for many decades surrounding Congress's enactment of the FTCA.[7] And neither this Court nor any other has accorded those words talismanic power to render time bars jurisdictional. To the contrary, we have construed the very same "shall be forever barred" language in 15 U. S. C. §15b, the Clayton Act's statute of limitations, to be subject to tolling; nothing in that provision, we found, "restrict[s] the power of the federal courts" to extend a limitations period when circumstances warrant. American Pipe & Constr. Co. v. Utah, 414 U. S. 538, 559 (1974) ; see Hardin v. City Title & Escrow Co., 797 F. 2d 1037, 1040 (CADC 1986) (calling §15(b) "a good example of a non-jurisdictional time limitation" based on its text and separation from the Clayton Act's jurisdic-tional provisions).[8] As the Government
   itself has previously acknowledged, referring to the "shall be forever barred" locution: "[T]hat type of language has more to do with the legal rhetoric at the time the statute was passed" than with anything else, and should not "make[ ] a difference" to the jurisdictional analysis. Tr. of Oral Arg. in Irwin, O. T. 1990, No. 89-5867, p. 30. Or, put just a bit differ-ently: Congress's inclusion of a phrase endemic to limitations statutes of that era, at least some of which allow tolling, cannot provide the requisite clear statement that a time bar curtails a court's authority.

   Indeed, in two decisions directly addressing the Tucker Act's statute of limitations, this Court dismissed the idea that the language the Government relies on here has jurisdictional significance. Twice we described the words in that provision as not meaningfully different from those in a nonjurisdictional statute of limitations. And twice we made clear that the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act's time bar has precious little to do with its phrasing.

   We first did so in Irwin. Using our newly minted presumption, see supra, at 4-5, we decided there that the limitations period governing Title VII suits against the Government, 42 U. S. C. §2000e-16(c) (1988 ed.), allowed equitable tolling. In reaching that conclusion, we compared §2000e-16(c)'s text (then stating that an employee "may file a civil action" within 30 days of an agency's denial of her claim) with the language of the Tucker Act's time bar. We noted that we had formerly held the Tucker Act's limitations statute to "jurisdictionally bar[ ]" late claims, and we acknowledged the possibility of justifying that different treatment by characterizing its "language [as] more stringent than" §2000e-16(c)'s. Irwin, 498 U. S., at 94-95. But we rejected that reasoning, instead finding that the two formulations were materially alike. "[W]e are not persuaded," we stated, "that the difference between them is enough to manifest a different congressional intent with respect to the availability
   of equitable tolling." Id., at 95. Leaving for another day the question of what did account for the jurisdictional status of the Tucker Act's time bar, the Court thus ruled out reliance on its language. In other words, on the core question the Government raises here--whether the phrase "shall be forever barred," as used in both the Tucker Act and the FTCA, manifests a congressional decision to preclude tolling--Irwin said no.

   More recently, John R. Sand reaffirmed that conclusion, even as it refused to overturn our century-old view that the Tucker Act's time bar is jurisdictional. No less than three times, John R. Sand approvingly repeated Irwin's statement that the textual differences between the Tucker Act's time bar and §2000e-16(c) were insignificant--i.e., that the language of the two provisions could not explain why the former was jurisdictional and the latter not. See 552 U. S., at 137, 139 (calling the provisions "linguistically similar," "similar . . . in language," and "similarly worded"). But if that were so, John R. Sand asked, why not hold that the Tucker Act's time limit, like §2000e-16(c), is nonjurisdictional? The answer came down to two words: stare decisis. The Tucker Act's bar was different because it had been the subject of "a definitive earlier interpretation." Id., at 138; see id., at 137; supra, at 10. And for that reason alone, John R. Sand left in place our prior construction of the
   Tucker Act's time limit. See 552 U. S., at 139 (observing, in Justice Brandeis's words, that "it is more important that" the rule "be settled than that it be settled right" (quoting Burnet v. Coronado Oil & Gas Co., 285 U. S. 393, 406 (1932) (dissenting opinion))). What is special about the Tucker Act's deadline, John R. Sand recognized, comes merely from this Court's prior rulings, not from Congress's choice of wording.

   The Government thus cannot show that the phrase "shall be forever barred" in §2401(b) plainly signifies a jurisdictional statute, as our decisions require. See supra, at 6-7. Unlike in John R. Sand, here stare decisis plays no role: We have not previously considered whether §2401(b) restricts a court's authority. What we have done is to say, again and again, that the core language in that provision has no jurisdictional significance. It is materi-ally indistinguishable from the language in one nonjurisdic-tional time bar (i.e., §2000e-16(c)). See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95; John R. Sand, 552 U. S., at 137, 139. And it is identical to the language in another (i.e., 15 U. S. C. §15b). See American Pipe, 414 U. S., at 559. Yes, we have held that the Tucker Act's time bar, which includes those same words, constrains a court's power to hear late claims. But as we explained in Irwin, that is not because the phrase itself "manifest[s] a . . . congressional intent with respect to the availability of
   equitable tolling." 498 U. S., at 95. The words on which the Government pins its hopes are just the words of a limitations statute of a particular era. And nothing else supports the Government's claim that Congress, when enacting the FTCA, wanted to incorporate this Court's view of the Tucker Act's time bar--much less that Congress expressed that purported intent with the needed clear statement.

   B

   The Government next contends that at the time of the FTCA's enactment, Congress thought that every limitations statute applying to suits against the United States, however framed or worded, cut off a court's jurisdiction over untimely claims. On that view, the particular language of those statutes makes no difference. All that matters is that such time limits function as conditions on the Government's waiver of sovereign immunity. In that era--indeed, up until Irwin was decided--those conditions were generally supposed to be "strictly observed." Soriano, 352 U. S., at 276. That meant, the Government urges, that all time limits on actions against the United States "carr[ied] jurisdictional consequences." Brief for United States in Wong 34. Accordingly, the Government concludes, Congress "would have expected courts to apply [§2401(b)] as a jurisdictional requirement--just as conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity had always been applied." Id., at 32.

   Irwin, however, forecloses that argument. After all, Irwin also considered a pre-Irwin time bar attached to a waiver of sovereign immunity. The Government argued there--anticipating its claim here--that because §2000e-16(c)'s statute of limitations conditioned such a waiver, it must be jurisdictional and not subject to equitable tolling. See Brief for Respondents 6, 10, 14, 19, and Tr. of Oral Arg. 31-37, in Irwin, O. T. 1990, No. 89-5867. But Irwin disagreed, applying the opposite presumption to a time limit passed two decades earlier. See 498 U. S., at 94-96; supra, at 4-5. Justice White protested, much as the Government does now, that at the time of §2000e-16(c)'s enactment, limitations statutes for suits against the Government were "strictly observed" and not amenable to tolling. 498 U. S., at 97 (opinion concurring in part and concurring in judgment) (quoting Soriano, 352 U. S., at 276); see 498 U. S., at 99, n. 2. How could an earlier Congress, Justice White asked, have "had in mind
   the Court's present departure from that longstanding rule"? Ibid.; see post, at 9 (asking a variant of the same question). But the Irwin Court was undeterred. The Court noted that it had not applied the former rule so consistently as Justice White suggested. See 498 U. S., at 94. And the Court doubted that the former approach so well reflected congressional intent: On the contrary, because equitable tolling "amounts to little, if any, broadening of the congressional waiver," we thought that a rule generally allowing tolling is the more "realistic assessment of legislative intent." Id., at 95; see supra, at 4-5. For those reasons, the Court declined to count time bars as jurisdictional merely because they condition waivers of immunity--even if Congress enacted the deadline when the Court interpreted limitations statutes differently.

   In the years since, this Court has repeatedly followed Irwin's lead. We have applied Irwin to pre-Irwin statutes, just as we have to statutes that followed in that decision's wake. See Scarborough, 541 U. S., at 420-422; Franconia Associates v. United States, 536 U. S. 129, 145 (2002) . To be sure, Irwin's presumption is rebuttable. But the rebuttal cannot rely on what Irwin itself deemed irrelevant--that Congress passed the statute in an earlier era, when this Court often attached jurisdictional consequence to conditions on waivers of sovereign immunity. Rather, the rebuttal must identify something distinctive about the time limit at issue, whether enacted then or later--a reason for thinking Congress wanted that limitations statute (not all statutes passed in an earlier day) to curtail a court's jurisdiction. On the Government's contrary view, Irwin would effectively become only a prospective decision. Nothing could be less consonant with Irwin's ambition to adopt a "general rule to
   govern the applicability of equit-able tolling in suits against the Government." 498 U. S., at 95.

   And the Government's claim is peculiarly inapt as applied to §2401(b) because all that is special about the FTCA cuts in favor of allowing equitable tolling. As compared to other waivers of immunity (prominently including the Tucker Act), the FTCA treats the United States more like a commoner than like the Crown. The FTCA's jurisdictional provision states that courts may hear suits "under circumstances where the United States, if a private person, would be liable to the claimant." 28 U. S. C. §1346(b). And when defining substantive liability for torts, the Act reiterates that the United States is accountable "in the same manner and to the same extent as a private individual." §2674. In keeping with those provisions, this Court has often rejected the Government's calls to cabin the FTCA on the ground that it waives sovereign immunity--and indeed, the Court did so in the years immediately after the Act's passage, even as it was construing other waivers of immunity narrowly. See, e.g., United
   States v. Aetna Casualty & Surety Co., 338 U. S. 366, 383 (1949) ; Indian Towing Co. v. United States, 350 U. S. 61, 65 (1955) ; Rayonier Inc. v. United States, 352 U. S. 315 -320 (1957). There is no reason to do differently here. As Irwin recognized, treating the Government like a private person means (among other things) permitting equitable tolling. See 498 U. S., at 95-96. So in stressing the Government's equivalence to a private party, the FTCA goes further than the typical statute waiving sovereign immunity to indicate that its time bar allows a court to hear late claims.

   IV

   Our precedents make this a clear-cut case. Irwin requires an affirmative indication from Congress that it intends to preclude equitable tolling in a suit against the Government. See 498 U. S., at 95-96. Congress can provide that signal by making a statute of limitations jurisdictional. But that requires its own plain statement; otherwise, we treat a time bar as a mere claims-processing rule. See Auburn Regional, 568 U. S., at ___, ___ (slip op., at 6, 8). Congress has supplied no such statement here. As this Court has repeatedly stated, nothing about §2401(b)'s core language is special; "shall be forever barred" is an ordinary (albeit old-fashioned) way of setting a deadline, which does not preclude tolling when circumstances warrant. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95-96; John R. Sand, 552 U. S., at 137, 139; American Pipe, 414 U. S., at 558-559. And it makes no difference that a time bar conditions a waiver of sovereign immunity, even if Congress enacted the measure when different interpretive
   conventions applied; that is the very point of this Court's decision to treat time bars in suits against the Government, whenever passed, the same as in litigation between private parties. See Irwin, 498 U. S., at 95-96; Scarborough, 541 U. S., at 420-422; Franconia, 536 U. S., at 145. Accordingly, we hold that the FTCA's time bars are nonjurisdictional and subject to equitable tolling.

   We affirm the judgments of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit and remand the cases for further proceedings consistent with this opinion. On remand in June, it is for the District Court to decide whether, on the facts of her case, June is entitled to equitable tolling.

   It is so ordered.
