   IN RE DOW JONES & CO., INC.

   ON APPLICATION FOR STAY

   No. A-369. Decided December 5,1994

   The application of Dow Jones & Co., Inc., for a stay of the Court of Appeals' November 3,1994, order filed "under seal," so that Dow Jones can publish and report on the order and its contents, is moot. A later order in which the Court of Appeals denied Dow Jones' motion for reconsideration and discussed the November 3 order and its contents was not filed "under seal."

   CHIEF JUSTICE REHNQUIST, Circuit Justice.

   Opinion in Chambers

   sons for refusing to release the report of Independent Counsel Fiske. This order was not filed "under seal," and there is no indication that Dow Jones is prohibited from reporting on or publishing this order. Because Dow Jones may report on and publish this second order, which refers to the November 3, 1994, order and its contents, I believe that Dow Jones' emergency application for stay is moot.
