   JUSTICE STEVENS delivered the opinion of the Court.

   In Illinois, an employee who is discharged for filing a worker's compensation claim may recover compensatory and punitive damages from her employer. The question presented in this case is whether an employee covered by a collective bargaining agreement that provides her with a contractual remedy for discharge without just cause may enforce her state law remedy for retaliatory discharge. The Court of Appeals held that the application of the state tort remedy was preempted by § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. § 185. 823 F.2d 1031 (CA7 1987) (en banc). We disagree.


   Petitioner was employed in respondent's manufacturing plant in Herrin, Illinois. On December 5, 1984, she notified respondent that she had been injured in the course of her employment and requested compensation for her medical expenses pursuant to the Illinois Workers' Compensation Act. On December 11, 1984, respondent discharged her for filing a "false worker's compensation claim." Id. at 1033.

   The union representing petitioner promptly filed a grievance pursuant to the collective bargaining agreement that covered all production and maintenance employees in the Herrin plant. The agreement protected those employees, including petitioner, from discharge except for "proper" or "just" cause, App. 13-14, and established a procedure for the arbitration of grievances, id. at 10-11. The term grievance


   was broadly defined to encompass

   "any dispute between . . . the Employer and any employee, concerning the effect, interpretation, application, claim of breach or violation of this Agreement."

   Id. at 10. Ultimately, an arbitrator ruled in petitioner's favor and ordered respondent to reinstate her with full backpay. See id. at 25-26.

   Meanwhile, on July 9, 1985, petitioner commenced this action against respondent by filing a complaint in the Illinois Circuit Court for Williamson County, alleging that she had been discharged for exercising her rights under the Illinois workers' compensation laws. App. 2-4; see Kelsay v. Motorola, Inc., 74 Ill.2d 172, 384 N.E.2d 353 (1978); Midgett v. Sackett-Chicago, Inc., 105 Ill.2d 143, 473 N.E.2d 1280 (1984); see also Ill.Rev.Stat., ch. 48, &#2013266086; 138.4(h) (1987). Respondent removed the case to the Federal District Court on the basis of diversity of citizenship, and then filed a motion praying that the court either dismiss the case on preemption grounds or stay further proceedings pending the completion of the arbitration. Record, Doc. No. 7. Relying on our decision in Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202 (1985), the District Court dismissed the complaint. It concluded that the

   "claim for retaliatory discharge is 'inextricably intertwined' with the collective bargaining provision prohibiting wrongful discharge or discharge without just cause,"

   and that allowing the state law action to proceed would undermine the arbitration procedures set forth in the parties' contract. 618 F.Supp. 1448, 1449 (SD Ill.1985).

   The Court of Appeals agreed that the state law claim was preempted by § 301. In an en banc opinion, over the dissent of two judges, it rejected petitioner's argument that the tort action was not "inextricably intertwined" with the collective bargaining agreement because the disposition of a retaliatory discharge claim in Illinois does not depend upon an interpretation of the agreement; on the contrary, the court concluded that "the same analysis of the facts" was implicated under both procedures. 823 F.2d at 1046. It took note of, and


   declined to follow, contrary decisions in the Tenth, Third, and Second Circuits. [Footnote 1] We granted certiorari to resolve the conflict in the Circuits. 484 U.S. 895 (1987).


   Section 301(a) of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 156, 29 U.S.C. § 185(a), provides:

   "Suits for violation of contracts between an employer and a labor organization representing employees in an industry affecting commerce as defined in this Act, or between any such labor organizations, may be brought in any district court of the United States having jurisdiction of the parties, without respect to the amount in controversy or without regard to the citizenship of the parties."

   In Textile Workers v. Lincoln Mills, 353 U. S. 448 (1957), we held that § 301 not only provides federal court jurisdiction over controversies involving collective bargaining agreements, but also "authorizes federal courts to fashion a body of federal law for the enforcement of these collective bargaining agreements." Id. at 353 U. S. 451. [Footnote 2]

   In Teamsters v. Lucas Flour Co., 369 U. S. 95 (1962), we were confronted with a straightforward question of contract interpretation: whether a collective bargaining agreement implicitly prohibited a strike that had been called by the union. The Washington Supreme Court had answered that question by applying state law rules of contract interpretation.


   We rejected that approach, and held that § 301 mandated resort to federal rules of law in order to ensure uniform interpretation of collective bargaining agreements, and thus to promote the peaceable, consistent resolution of labor-management disputes. [Footnote 3]


   In Allis-Chalmers Corp. v. Lueck, 471 U. S. 202 (1985), we considered whether the Wisconsin tort remedy for bad-faith handling of an insurance claim could be applied to the handling of a claim for disability benefits that were authorized by a collective bargaining agreement. We began by examining the collective bargaining agreement, and determined that it provided the basis not only for the benefits, but also for the right to have payments made in a timely manner. Id. at 471 U. S. 213-216. We then analyzed the Wisconsin tort remedy, explaining that it

   "exists for breach of a 'duty devolv[ed] upon the insurer by reasonable implication from the express terms of the contract,' the scope of which, crucially, is 'ascertained from a consideration of the contract itself.'"

   Id. at 471 U. S. 216 (quoting Hilker v. Western Automobile Ins. Co., 204 Wis. 1, 16, 235 N.W. 413, 415 (1931)). Since the

   "parties' agreement as to the manner in which a benefit claim would be handled [would] necessarily [have been] relevant to any allegation that the claim was handled in a dilatory manner,"

   471 U.S. at 471 U. S. 218, we concluded that § 301 preempted the application of the Wisconsin tort remedy in this setting.

   Thus, Lueck faithfully applied the principle of § 301 preemption developed in Lucas Flour: [Footnote 4] if the resolution of a


   state law claim depends upon the meaning of a collective bargaining agreement, the application of state law (which might lead to inconsistent results since there could be as many state law principles as there are States) is preempted and federal labor law principles -- necessarily uniform throughout the nation -- must be employed to resolve the dispute. [Footnote 5]


   Illinois courts have recognized the tort of retaliatory discharge for filing a worker's compensation claim, Kelsay v. Motorola, Inc., 74 Ill.2d 172, 384 N.E.2d 353 (1978), [Footnote 6] and


   have held that it is applicable to employees covered by union contracts, Midgett v. Sackett-Chicago, Inc., 105 Ill.2d 143, 473 N.E.2d 1280 (1984), cert. denied, 474 U.S. 909 (1985).

   "[T]o show retaliatory discharge, the plaintiff must set forth sufficient facts from which it can be inferred that (1) he was discharged or threatened with discharge and (2) the employer's motive in discharging or threatening to discharge him was to deter him from exercising his rights under the Act or to interfere with his exercise of those rights."

   Horton v. Miller Chemical Co., 776 F.2d 1351, 1356 (CA7 1985) (summarizing Illinois state court decisions), cert. denied, 475 U.S. 1122 (1986); see Gonzalez v. Prestress Engineering Corp., 115 Ill.2d 1, 503 N.E.2d 308 (1986). Each of these purely factual questions pertains to the conduct of the employee and the conduct and motivation of the employer. Neither of the elements requires a court to interpret any term of a collective bargaining agreement. To defend against a retaliatory discharge claim, an employer must show that it had a nonretaliatory reason for the discharge, cf. Loyola University of Chicago v. Illinois Human Rights Comm'n, 149 Ill.App.3d 8, 500 N.E.2d 639 (1986); this purely factual inquiry likewise does not turn on the meaning of any provision of a collective bargaining agreement. Thus, the state law remedy in this case is "independent" of the collective bargaining agreement in the sense of "independent" that matters for § 301 preemption purposes: resolution of the state law
   claim does not require construing the collective bargaining agreement. [Footnote 7]


   The Court of Appeals seems to have relied upon a different way in which a state law claim may be considered "independent" of a collective bargaining agreement. The court wrote that "the just cause provision in the collective bargaining agreement may well prohibit such retaliatory discharge," and went on to say that, if the state law cause of action could go forward,

   "a state court would be deciding precisely the same issue as would an arbitrator: whether there was 'just cause' to discharge the worker."

   823 F.2d at 1046 (emphasis added). The court concluded,

   "the state tort of retaliatory discharge is inextricably intertwined with the collective bargaining agreements here, because it implicates the same analysis of the facts as would an inquiry under the just cause provisions of the agreements."

   Ibid. (emphasis added). We agree with the Court's explanation that the state law analysis might well involve attention to the same factual considerations as the contractual determination of whether Lingle was fired for just cause. But we disagree with the court's conclusion that such parallelism renders the state law analysis dependent upon the contractual analysis. For, while there may be instances in which the National Labor Relations Act preempts state law on the basis of the subject matter


   of the law in question, [Footnote 8] § 301 preemption merely ensures that federal law will be the basis for interpreting collective bargaining agreements, and says nothing about the substantive rights a State may provide to workers when adjudication of those rights does not depend upon the interpretation of such agreements. [Footnote 9] In other words, even if dispute resolution


   pursuant to a collective bargaining agreement, on the one hand, and state law, on the other, would require addressing precisely the same set of facts, as long as the state law claim can be resolved without interpreting the agreement itself, the claim is "independent" of the agreement for § 301 preemption purposes. [Footnote 10]

IV

   The result we reach today is consistent both with the policy of fostering uniform, certain adjudication of disputes over the


   meaning of collective bargaining agreements and with cases that have permitted separate fonts of substantive rights to remain unpreempted by other federal labor law statutes.

   First, as we explained in Lueck,

   "[t]he need to preserve the effectiveness of arbitration was one of the central reasons that underlay the Court's holding in Lucas Flour."

   471 U.S. at 471 U. S. 219.

   "A rule that permitted an individual to sidestep available grievance procedures would cause arbitration to lose most of its effectiveness, . . . as well as eviscerate a central tenet of federal labor contract law under § 301 that it is the arbitrator, not the court, who has the responsibility to interpret the labor contract in the first instance."

   Id. at 481 U. S. 220. See Paperworkers v. Misco, Inc., 484 U. S. 29 (1987); Steelworkers v. Enterprise Wheel & Car Corp., 363 U. S. 593 (1960). Today's decision should make clear that interpretation of collective bargaining agreements remains firmly in the arbitral realm; [Footnote 11] judges can determine questions of state law involving labor-management relations only if such questions do not require construing collective bargaining agreements.

   Second, there is nothing novel about recognizing that substantive rights in the labor relations context can exist without interpreting collective bargaining agreements.

   "This Court has, on numerous occasions, declined to hold that individual employees are, because of the availability of arbitration, barred from bringing claims under federal statutes. See, e.g., McDonald v. West Branch, 466 U. S. 284 (1984); Barrentine v. Arkansas-Best Freight System, Inc., 450 U. S. 728 (1981); Alexander v. Gardner-Denver Co., 415 U. S. 36 (1974). Although the analysis of the question under each statute is quite distinct, the theory running through these cases is that,


   notwithstanding the strong policies encouraging arbitration,"

   "different considerations apply where the employee's claim is based on rights arising out of a statute designed to provide minimum substantive guarantees to individual workers."

   "Barrentine, supra, at 450 U. S. 737."

   Atchison, T. & S. F. R. Co. v. Buell, 480 U. S. 557, 480 U. S. 564-565 (1987) (emphasis added).

   Although our comments in Buell, construing the scope of Railway Labor Act preemption, referred to independent federal statutory rights, we subsequently rejected a claim that federal labor law preempted a state statute providing a one-time severance benefit to employees in the event of a plant closing. In Fort Halifax Packing Co. v. Coyne, 482 U. S. 1, 482 U. S. 21 (1987), we emphasized that "preemption should not be lightly inferred in this area, since the establishment of labor standards falls within the traditional police power of the State." We specifically held that the Maine law in question was not preempted by the NLRA, "since its establishment of a minimum labor standard does not impermissibly intrude upon the collective bargaining process." Id. at 482 U. S. 23.

   The Court of Appeals

   "recognize[d] that § 301 does not preempt state antidiscrimination laws, even though a suit under these laws, like a suit alleging retaliatory discharge, requires a state court to determine whether just cause existed to justify the discharge."

   823 F.2d at 1046, n. 17. The court distinguished those laws because Congress has affirmatively endorsed state antidiscrimination remedies in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 78 Stat. 241, see 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-5(c) and 2000e-7, whereas there is no such explicit endorsement of state workers' compensation laws. As should be plain from our discussion in 486 U. S. supra, this distinction is unnecessary for determining whether § 301 preempts the state law in question. The operation of the antidiscrimination laws does, however, illustrate the relevant point for § 301 preemption analysis that the mere fact that a broad contractual protection against discriminatory -- or retaliatory


   -- discharge may provide a remedy for conduct that coincidentally violates state law does not make the existence or the contours of the state law violation dependent upon the terms of the private contract. For even if an arbitrator should conclude that the contract does not prohibit a particular discriminatory or retaliatory discharge, that conclusion might or might not be consistent with a proper interpretation of state law. In the typical case, a state tribunal could resolve either a discriminatory or retaliatory discharge claim without interpreting the "just cause" language of a collective bargaining agreement.

   In sum, we hold that an application of state law is preempted by § 301 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 only if such application requires the interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement. [Footnote 12]

   The judgment of the Court of Appeals is reversed.

   It is so ordered.
