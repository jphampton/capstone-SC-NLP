   The Federal Communications Commission's application to vacate the Sixth Circuit's stay preventing the FCC from taking any action in furtherance of a nationwide auction of a portion of the electromagnetic spectrum is granted.

   harm to respondent. I should point out that because respondent has not filed an opposition to the application, my opinion is based on the factual representations in the FCC's papers.

   Accordingly, the application to vacate the stay is granted.
